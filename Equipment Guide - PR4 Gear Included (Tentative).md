# PvE Equipment Guide
This guide is meant to serve as both an in-depth guide to end-game equipment and a quick reference to compare pieces of equipment in a given slot. Letter grades represent general usability of a given piece of equipment. 
 - **S-rank** equipment is going to be best-in-slot for most ships and in most use cases
 - **A-rank** equipment is either easier to acquire than S-rank equipment and good enough for general use, or is more difficult to obtain while not providing enough of an appreciable difference in performance to be worth recommending in all cases
 - **B-rank** equipment might not be strong enough to warrant a recommendation for general use, but occupies a specific niche that might make it best-in-slot for select scenarios or when equipped to certain ships
 - **Tentative** stamps denote that a given piece of equipment's ranking is, due to limited availability and data, based predominantly on theoretical data.

## Foreword and Glossary

This guide makes extensive use of the [Azur Lane Koumakan Wiki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp) and expects the reader to be familiar with the terms used within. Familiarising yourself with the wiki and the variables stated on each equipment's respective page will allow you to make far better use of this guide. This is not a beginner's guide and should not be treated as one; prerequisite knowledge of the game's mechanisms is required to make full sense of the descriptions hereafter.

**Alpha** - Raw shell damage value.

**Deadzone** - Refers to the discrepancy between a gun's target acquisition range (Firing Range) and shell range. A gun with a significantly large deadzone may fire off shells that fail to make contact with a target as the shells despawn before landing on target.

**Volley Time** - Refers to the minimum time between successive gun mounts firing off on a single target. Differs from one gun to another.

**Non-Zero Volley Time** - Any volley time value above 0s.

 **Preface about DD Guns:** You are using them to primarily deal damage to Light and Medium armoured targets - the vast majority of enemies in the game belong to one of these two hull types. While they *can* do decent damage against Heavy armoured targets, it is still less than what a typical torpedo spread can accomplish. Therefore for general usage on DD guns, DD Normal guns are prefered over DD HE guns **where all other factors are equivalent** due to the superior ammo characteristics of DD Normal ammo. This includes but is not limited to bullet range and shell velocity, even though normal ammo typically comes at a cost to damage you can deal to Heavy targets.
 - **[Single 138.6mm Mle1929](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_138.6mm_(Mle_1929)#Type_3)** | One of the hardest hitting DD guns available, to the point where it's worth using even on ships with relatively strong barrages despite its relatively slow fire rate. One of two DD guns capable of giving the highest FP boost (+35 FP), but comes with a deadzone. If you *have* to bring a DD gun against Heavy targets, this is your best candidate.
 - **[Twin 130mm B-2LM](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_130mm_(B-2LM)#Type_3)** | Longer reload, better volume of fire and most importantly - fires special Normal ammo that has the same modifier against Medium armor as HE ammo. The advantages of this gun over the aforementioned Single 138.6mm Mle1929 are: a better pattern, superior target acquisiton, higher targeting and bullet range, faster shell velocity leading to excellent hit rate, and no deadzone. If one were to look really closely for faults with this gun, it has worse firing angles at only 200 degrees compared to a full 360 degrees like other DD guns. It's also event-locked, with only 2 copies ever having been made obtainable.
 - **[Twin 114mm (QF Mk IV Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_114mm_(QF_Mk_IV_Prototype))** | Overall, the best permanently available DD gun. It has slightly lower theoretical DPS when compared to the Single 138.6mm Mle1929's output against Light and Medium armour, however its significantly higher rate of fire lets it pull ahead in most scenarios by increasing the frequency of barrages. It also has a better shell pattern, faster shell velocity and no deadzone, leading to excellent hit rate in practice. It does, however, have a slightly lower target acquisition range as well as split stats (+25 FP and +20 AA).
 - **[Twin 120mm (QF Mk XI)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_120mm_(QF_Mark_XI)#Type_0)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** Comparable to the Twin 114mm as a variant with higher alpha damage per volley, but with a longer reload time amd small deadzone. In practice, this gun is rarely - if ever - preferable to the Twin 114mm since it gives up the former's high rate of fire and barrage triggering abilities for alpha damage that can't quite compare to what the Twin 130mm and Single 138.6mm Mle1929 offer. It is, however, a straight upgrade to the Twin 120mm QF Mk XII that many players have in excess and worth consideration if gear availability is an issue. It also offers +25 AA over its predecessor.
 - **[Twin 128mm/45 SK C/41](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_128mm/45_SK_C/41)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** The best DD gun against Medium targets, and the only DD AP gun worth mentioning. If you're facing a Medium target boss - or there's a Medium target-rich environment - this is the prime DD gun for the job. Look elsewhere otherwise.
 - **[Twin 120mm QF Mark XII](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_120mm_(QF_Mark_XII)#Type_3)** | The strongest readily accessible general-use main gun. It has high damage output with an average reload speed for damage-focused guns, and great accuracy. Its only downside is the one all DD Normal shells have - drastically reduced damage against Heavy targets.
 - **[Twin 127mm Mk38](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_127mm_(5%22/38_Mk38)#Type_3)** provides a split of FP and AA boosts. While its theoretical damage output is alright, its low FP boost, relatively slow rate of fire and large deadzone marr its merits, causing it to fall behind other, more accessible alternatives such as the Twin 120mm QF Mk XII.
 - **[Single 127mm Mk30](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_127mm_(5%22/38_Mk30)#Type_3)** | The fastest firing HE gun, while also having very high damage stats. It's a good intermediary equipment choice for destroyers with both strong barrages and high gunnery stats. Its 25 degree spread reduces its actual gun damage in practice, making it a poor choice for destroyers with weak barrages. 
 - **[Twin 100mm Type 98](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_100mm_(Type_98)#Type_3)** | Generally used on ships with strong barrages, but has since been superseded by the Twin 114mm above. However, its damage output isn't too far behind other alternatives against most targets and its volume of fire is higher than any other gun, making it a viable intermediary option.
 - **[Single 120mm QF Mark IX](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_120mm_(QF_Mark_IX)#Type_3)** and **[Single 76mm](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_76mm_(3%22/50_caliber_gun)#Type_3)** | The fastest destroyer guns in the game and used on a select handful of ships who are willing to sacrifice nearly all gunnery damage for faster barrage triggers and/or skill procs. The 120mm trades a very small amount of reload speed compared to the 76mm for higher base damage and longer range.

  - **[Single 138.6mm Mle1929](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_138.6mm_(Mle_1929)#Type_3)** | Gives the highest FP boost possible from DD guns and has a very high volume of fire despite its long reload time. 
  - **[Twin 130mm B-2LM](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_130mm_(B-2LM)#Type_3)** | Also gives the highest FP boost, has an even higher volume of fire and better shell characteristics despite the longer reload time when compared to the Single 138.6mm Mle1929. Due to its limited availability, there are better ships that might benefit from this gun more than using it as an auxiliary gun depending on the composition of the fleet in question.
  - **[Twin 114mm (QF Mk IV Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_114mm_(QF_Mk_IV_Prototype))** | Aside from the rate of fire, it also has an preferable shell firing pattern as well as faster shell velocity with no deadzone, giving it an excellent hit rate. It does, however, have a slightly lower target acquisition range as well as split stats (+25 FP and +20 AA), but even then it is a worthwhile choice as an auxiliary gun.
   - **[Twin 120mm (QF Mk XI)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_120mm_(QF_Mark_XI)#Type_0)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** The higher alpha damage per volley makes this gun preferable as a vanguard secondary if interception is purely down to the vanguard. Being able to successfully intercept a suicide ship in one volley, with the preferable shell characteristics of Normal ammo, makes this gun a comparatively good option that's also obtainable with time. Players will have to weigh the cost of obtaining these with their own needs.
   - **[Twin 128mm/45 SK C/41](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_128mm/45_SK_C/41)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** The AP shells fired from this gun have the velocity to make them very good at suicide boat interception. The gun also provides a hefty +30 FP boost together with +15 AA, which is a far more welcome gain for the ship equipping this gun.
  - **[Twin 100mm Type 98](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_100mm_(Type_98)#Type_3)** | Has relatively weak raw damage output. It's not too far behind the more damage focused guns on its own, but its low FP boost widens the gap slightly more. However, the Type 98 has the highest volume of fire, which can assist in breaking enemy shields faster, thereby increasing its performance beyond what stats would imply. Additionally, it provides the highest AA boost among all DD guns.
  - **[Twin 120mm QF Mark XII](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_120mm_(QF_Mark_XII)#Type_3)** | Comes with the highest FP boost of any readily accessible gun with an accurate firing pattern and the preferable shell characteristics of Normal ammo. 
  - **[Twin 127mm Mk38](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_127mm_(5%22/38_Mk38)#Type_3)** | Provides a split of FP and AA, causing its effective damage output to be lower than its stats would imply. Its HE shells give it an advantage against Heavy targets, but the low shell velocity of HE shells makes it poorer at suicide boat interception compared to the Twin 120mm QF Mk XII despite the two guns having superficially identical shell patterns.
  - **[Single 127mm Mk30](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_127mm_(5%22/38_Mk30)#Type_3)** | HE shells give it an advantage against Heavy targets, but hamper its effectiveness at interception. Low volume of fire and high spread further hamper its effectiveness, only useful when fighting Heavy targets or pressed for options.

  **Preface about DD guns as Main Fleet Secondaries:** While DD guns can typically deal with solo suicide boats, their interception capability is much lower compared to CL guns - especially when attempting to intercept a high density of suicide boats coming in for your backline. DD guns have an inherently shorter range and lower alpha damage compared to CL guns, and the most valuable stats for interception are range and alpha damage. Consider using battleships that can mount CL secondary guns whenever suicide boats are an active concern.
  
  - **[Twin 128mm/45 SK C/41](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_128mm/45_SK_C/41)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** While its damage output as a main gun is generally sub-par outside of Medium target-rich environments, it finds its niche as a secondary gun - AP shells give it the fastest interception times of any guns in its class. The gun also provides a hefty +30 FP boost together with +15 AA, making it the best all-round secondary gun for main fleet ships locked to using DD guns as secondaries.
  - **[Twin 120mm (QF Mk XI)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_120mm_(QF_Mark_XI)#Type_0)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** As it was for vanguard interception, this gun's high alpha allows it to intercept fireboats when used as a main fleet secondary with more reliability than its predecessor and the Twin 114mm. Do note that this gun gives up +5 FP for +20 AA compared to the Twin 120mm QF Mk XII, for when stat gains are more of a concern than interception. 
  - **[Twin 120mm QF Mark XII](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_120mm_(QF_Mark_XII)#Type_3)** | Has weaker interception capabilities than the Twin 128mm/45, but its high damage per shot allows it to get kills when equipped on ships that might struggle otherwise. 
  - **[Twin 130mm B-2LM](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_130mm_(B-2LM)#Type_3)** | Similar to the Twin 120mm QF Mk XII in practice but also gives the highest FP boost. Due to limited availability, there are better ships that might benefit from this gun more than using it as a main fleet secondary gun.
  - **[Twin 114mm (QF Mk IV Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_114mm_(QF_Mk_IV_Prototype))** | A poor candidate for use as a main fleet secondary owing to its reduced target acquisition range. This often hampers its ability to reliably take out suicide boats that are off to the flanks of the ship it's equipped on. 
  - **[Twin 127mm Mk38](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_127mm_(5%22/38_Mk38)#Type_3)** | Has comparable performance to the Twin 120mm QF Mk XII. However, the lower velocity of its HE shells cause it to struggle slightly when firing off to the flanks, and it has a lower FP boost in return for some additional AA.
  - **[Twin 100mm Type 98](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_100mm_(Type_98)#Type_3)** and **[Single 138.6mm Mle1929](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_138.6mm_(Mle_1929)#Type_3)** | The former provides the highest boost to AA, while the latter provides the highest FP boost. Worth using when interception is a non-concern and the stat boost is preferred.

  **Preface about CL guns as Vanguard Primaries:** For any vanguard ship that can choose between equipping a DD or CL gun, always equip them with a DD gun. DD calibre guns have higher damage per second, and their faster fire rate leads to faster barrages and/or skill procs. Refer to the DD section above.
  
 - **[Triple 152mm Mk17 DP Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_(Mark_17_Dual-Purpose_Prototype))** | Addresses the primary issue holding back HE light cruiser guns: their wide spread. The Mk17 DP has damage stats that give it theoretical DPS comparable to the next strongest HE gun, but its lack of any dead zone and preferable targeted shell pattern allows it to reach its theoretical DPS in practice. True to its name, it also provides a split between boosting FP and AA, making it the only CL gun to do so. 
 - **[Triple 152mm (MK-5)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_(MK-5)#Type_3)** | Comes with theoretical stats comparable to the Triple 152mm Mk17 DP, with only a smidge less DPS while providing the highest firepower bonus. The major flaws of this weapon are its slightly higher spread and a large deadzone despite having a target acquisition range equivalent to the Mk17 DP. This might compromise its practical hit rate at longer ranges and a very slightly slower barrage.
 - **[Triple 152mm BL Mark XXV Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_Prototype_(BL_6%22_Mk_XXV))** | The strongest AP CL gun. It has an incredibly fast fire rate, the longest range of any CL gun and high base damage. However, its relatively wide spread for an AP gun may give it slight accuracy issues at the extremities of its target acquisition range. Preferable if one lacks either of the two CL HE options above.
 - **[Twin 150mm TbtsK C/36](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_150mm_(TbtsK_C/36)#Type_3)** | Its stats may not look impressive on paper with the low base damage per volley compared to most alternatives. However, it has a hyper-accurate shell pattern and is one of the only CL guns in the game capable of actually dealing its theoretical DPS, and that's without accounting for AP shells' penetration capabilities. The premier budget option.
 - **[Single 150 SK C/28](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Single_150mm_(SK_C/28)#Type_3)** | The fastest firing CL gun. Sees use on CLs who have exceptionally strong barrages when manual play is involved.

 - **[Triple 152mm BL Mark XXV Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_Prototype_(BL_6%22_Mk_XXV))** | Has the longest range of any CL gun, coupled with a high firepower bonus that makes it the best auxiliary gun for general use. 
 - **[Triple 152mm Mk16](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_(6%22/47_Mk_16)#Type_3)** | Exceptional at interception thanks to its high alpha damage per shell, wide spread, and zero second volley time. Exceptionally easy to acquire as well.
 - **[Triple 152mm (MK-5)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_(MK-5)#Type_3)** | While this gun has a non-zero volley time, its high shell density and damage per volley coupled with the high FP bonus makes it one of the better non-zero volley time interception guns.
 - **[Triple 155mm (3rd Year Type)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_155mm_(3rd_Year_Type)#Type_3)** | Relatively weak at interception, thanks to its short range, non-zero volley time, and low shell density. However, it's a very accessible gun with a high FP boost, making it a useful gun in any situation where interception is non-concern, or the gun itself is capable of handling any incoming threats. In most situations, it is.
 - **[Twin 152mm BL Mark XXIII](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_152mm_(BL_6%22_Mk_XXII)#Type_3)** | Comes with comparable interception capabilities to the Triple 152mm Mk16, but trades raw volume of fire for AP shells. Useful in certain situations where the penetration capabilities of AP shells is desirable.
 - **[Triple 152mm Mk17 DP Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_152mm_(Mark_17_Dual-Purpose_Prototype))** | Another gun with non-zero volley time which impacts its interception capabilities. Gives a split of FP and AA as well, further hampering its ability to contribute to FP which is often the more important stat for main fleet ships. Given its rarity and relatively weak interception qualities, it is better suited to its role as the premier CL main gun instead.
 - **[Twin 150mm TbtsK C/36](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_150mm_(TbtsK_C/36)#Type_3)** | Has a few advantages for interception in specific niche scenarios, but is generally poorly suited for general use. Its hyper-accurate firing pattern allows a ship to pump more concentrated damage into a single target than any other available CL gun. Additionally, its AP shells can penetrate - allowing it to deal with certain patterns of suicide boats that other non-AP guns might struggle with.

**Preface about CA guns:** Unlike other vanguard calibre guns where no one ammo type is strictly superior (or if one appears to be superior it's due to characteristics aside from ammo type), the armour modifiers on CA guns are drastically different across the various ammo types. Enough to warrant the use of different guns when engaging Light, Medium or Heavy targets, or a mix of all three. Note that evey CA gun in the game has a large deadzone regardless of the ammo type being used - there's a known, significant tendency for shells to despawn before reaching targets at the extremeties of CA guns' acquisition range.

 - **[Triple 234mm (BL 9.2" Mk XII Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_234mm_(BL_9.2%22_Mk_XII_Prototype))** | Is the strongest CA gun in the game in nearly every scenario. It has the highest FP boost and comes with special armour modifiers that give it an edge against any armor type, causing it to have the highest DPS regardless of the target it's shooting at. This gun is such a large improvement over alternatives that it elevates the DPS capability of any gunCA that can take full advantage of its strengths with their additional gun mount. The sole downside to this gun would be the difficulty in obtaining even a single copy, but if you have one there is no reason not to equip it on nearly any gunCA.
 - **[Twin 234mm (BL 9.2" Mk XII Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_234mm_(BL_9.2%22_Mk_XII_Prototype))** | Despite not having the overpowered qualities of its triple barrelled variant, it still has exceptionally good DPS and reload speed - only negligibly slower than that of the Twin 203mm Mle1924 while being much more accessible by virtue of not being event locked. Benefiting from similarly improved overall armour modifiers, the Twin 234mm is better than other guns for mobbing situations where you are likely to run into enemies with different armor types. It's also only second in terms of effectiveness against Heavy targets among non-rainbow CA guns.
 - **[Triple 203mm Prototype SK C/34](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_203mm_Prototype_(SK_C/34))** | One of two worthwhile AP CA guns. While it has a relatively wide spread, its fire rate and volley time are heavily improved over the Twin 203mm SK C/34. In particular, the reduction in volley time from 1s to 0.5s with improved shell pattern makes this prototype perform far better than its non-prototype predecessor in practice.
  - **[Triple 203mm Mk 15 SHS](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_203mm_(8%22/55_Mk_15_SHS))** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** The other worthwhile AP CA gun. Nearly a carbon copy of the Triple 203mm SK C/34, the Mk 15 SHS has two advantages up its sleeve: it's not locked behind PR1 research and comes with improved armour modifiers against Heavy. Improved to the point where this gun becomes the best non-rainbow gun against Heavy targets, in fact.
 - **[Twin 203mm Model 1927](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_203mm_(Model_1927)#Type_3)** | Fires special Semi-Armour Piercing (SAP) shells, which deal increased damage against Medium armour and decreased damage against other armour types compared to standard CA AP shells. While the gun is slightly hampered by its incredibly long reload and animation times, its unique ammo type allows it to pull ahead in terms of damage dealt against Medium targets compared to the Triple 203mm Protype SK C/34 and Mk 15 SHS. Additionally, it has a much more accurate firing pattern that can allow it to pull ahead in certain other situations, especially when utilising manual play in order to compensate for the gun's long animation time.
 - **[Twin 203mm Mle1924](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_203mm_(Mle_1924)#Type_3)** | Combines the best properties of various CA HE guns. This gun has the superior pattern and volume of fire of the Twin 203mm No.3, the theoretical DPS of the Mle1934, improved shell velocity equivalent to CA Normal ammo, *and* has the highest shell range of any CA HE gun. The gun has a longer reload time than the Mle1934, but this too can be an advantage for CAs with skills that have a 5s Internal Cooldown(ICD) such as Wichita, Bremerton, and many others. Its only fault would be that it's event locked.
 - **[Triple 203mm BL Mk IX Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_203mm_(BL_Mk_IX_Prototype))** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** In theory, the best non-rainbow HE gun against Light targets. In practice, the increased spread causes fewer shells to land on target, causing it to perform comparably to both the Mle1924 and Mle1934 while requiring more materials to craft than the No. 3. Craft with caution.
 - **[Triple Prototype 203mm Mle1934 Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_203mm_Prototype_(Mle_1934))** | Has the fastest fire rate of any HE CA gun and top-tier damage. Formerly the uncontested top dog of CA HE guns, this gun is still a perfectly viable alternative that has the benefit of not being event locked, assuming you're willing to do PR1 Research.
 - **[Twin 203mm No. 3 Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_203mm_Prototype_(No._3))** | Sacrifices a small amount of fire rate and damage per volley compared to the Mle1934 for superior target acquisition and volume of fire. It has the potential to pull ahead in certain situations such as when fighting more mobile targets. This gun is also craftable in the Gear Lab at a rather cheap material cost.
 - **[Twin 203mm (3rd Year Type)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_203mm_(3rd_Year_Type)#Type_3)** and **[Twin 203mm SK C/34](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_203mm_(SK_C/34)#Type_3)** | Weaker, but more accessible versions of their respective prototype counterparts. The Twin 203mm 3rd Year Type in particular is far more easily obtainable, and serves as a better budget option for newer players than the SK C/34.

**About this section:** Found here are guns that only a select few ships can equip, and are therefore mentioned separately from the rest of the CA calibre guns. It's worth noting that Azuma in particular always wants to have her gun equipped due to the synergy it has with her skills.

 - **[Submarine Mounted Twin 203mm Mle1924](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Submarine-mounted_Twin_203mm_Cannon_Mle1924)** | Can only be equipped on the French submarine Surcouf, and is the only gun she can equip. 
 
 The following guns are classified as Large Cruiser guns - these fire their shells in an arc, similar in nature to battleship calibre shells. This allows them to bypass shields entirely which leads to an increase in their damage output in practice compared to the CA guns discussed above in shield-rich environments.
 
 - **[Triple 310mm (Type 0 Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_310mm_(Type_0_Prototype))** | The only HE CB gun presently in the game. Due to its synergy with Azuma's skills, its foremost use is as the premier gun to equip her with.
 - **[Triple 305mm SK C/39 Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_305mm_(SK_C/39_Prototype)#CB_Variant)** | An improved AP CB gun compared to the Triple 283mm SK C/28 found below. Usable by both Agir and Azuma, albeit that Agir is the only one with preferable skill synergy with this gun. 
 - **[Triple 283mm SK C/28](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_283mm_(SK_C/28)#Type_3)** | A CB gun with a unique quirk - it's equippable by select CAs. Namely, the Deutschland-class and Prinz Heinrich - albeit that the 283mm's CA AP armour modifiers stand at odds with the Deutschland-class' niche of doing more damage to Light targets. Prinz Heinrich can theoretically make good use of the 283mm in shield-rich environments, but she performs just as well following the usual CA gun selection guidelines.

## Main Fleet (BB/BC/BM/BBV) Guns
**About BB Guns:** Due to the burst-damage nature of battleship main guns, they're grouped together based on their expected reload speeds. The highest direct damage guns tend to have firing timers longer than 20s, while the fastest guns have firing timers shorter than 18s and are generally best suited for use on ships with powerful skills that proc on main gun fire. This leaves a select handful of guns that fall into the 18-20s band. These guns have the potential to outdamage the slower guns under the right circumstances, while also still being fast enough to function well on ships with proc-on-fire skills.<br/><br/>In general, battleships used for mob clearing will also prefer a gun with a faster rate of fire due to their damage output coming out more often and the tendency for higher damage guns to overkill mob units.

 - **[Triple 406mm Mk7](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_406mm_(16%22/50_Mk_7))** | The strongest BB HE gun in the game. If you need to employ the use of BB HE in taking out a Light boss and want to maximise your damage, this is your pick. Confers a larger FP boost than the Mk6 with shells that have a higher alpha while having a negligibly slower reload. 
 - **[Triple 406mm Mk6](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_406mm_(16%22/45_Mk_6)#Type_3)** | Holds its spot as the most readily available BB HE gun. Despite being a purple gun, it comes with alpha values that allows it to outmatch the Triple 381mm BL until the latter is taken to +13. And even then, the Triple 381mm only performs marginally better than what a +11 Mk6 offers. A truly dependable workhorse.
 - **[Triple 406mm Mle 1938](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_406mm_(Mle_1938_Prototype))** | The best triple barrelled BB AP option around. Comes with improved armour modifiers and higher internal coefficient that gives it only slightly lower DPS than the vaunted Twin 457mm Mk A in a vacuum. However, as a triple gun, it is able to take advantage of buff/debuff timings that the Twin 457mm would miss (Helena's debuff windows, for example). Since burns are not affected by buffs/debuffs, its DPS is usually higher than that of an HE gun with burns against Medium and Heavy targets. It also has a tighter spread than the typical triple gun, and faster than usual shell speed making it incredibly accurate on the first volley since the hits often land while the slowdown is still in effect. As it is more accessible than the Twin 457mm, it is *the* go-to AP gun for most players. 
 - **[Triple 406mm Model 1940 Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_406mm_(Model_1940_Prototype))** | The best triple barrelled BB gun against Medium targets specifically. Almost pointless against Heavy targets and lacklustre against Light ones, this gun's specialisation makes it a niche pick at best. Possible application in mobbing situations where Medium targets are aplenty, and Light targets' low HP pools make the reduced armour modifiers of the SAP shells compared to HE ones a non-issue.
 - **[Triple 381mm Prototype BL MkIII](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_381mm_Prototype_(BL_15%22_Mk_III))** | Sacrifices some shelling damage compared to the Mk6 for a faster reload speed and higher FP bonus. Useful for coordinating reload timings for battleships that need to fire before others in order to make use of proc-on-fire buffs, debuffs, or other effects. Its shelling deficiencies are completely addressed when taken to +13 - an expensive upgrade, but one that long-term players can consider.
 - **[Quadruple 380mm Mle1935](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Quadruple_380mm_(Mle_1935)#Type_3)** | The signature - and historical - gun for Jean Bart, given that only she can make good use of it with her skill synergies. Its high alpha damage and volume of fire give it potential use on other ships, especially for mobbing fleets, but its 2-by-2 firing pattern and increased spread drastically reduces its efficacy against non-stationary bosses. Best kept on Jean herself.
 - **[Triple 410mm Prototype (10th Year Type)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_410mm_Prototype_(10th_Year_Type))** | Has comparable base stats to the Mk6, but fires AP shells. While this reduces its value as a general-use gun, it's still a decent gun when fighting bosses with Medium or Heavy armour. However, it lacks the improved armour modifiers found on the Triple 406mm Mle 1938, resulting in it being a direct downgrade at this juncture. Usable, but no longer the best suited BB AP gun for taking out Medium and Heavy targets.
 - **[Triple 381mm M1934](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_381mm_(Model_1934)#Type_3)** | Consider the Triple 381mm M1934 as a sidegrade to the Triple 410mm Prototype, and downgrade to the Triple 406mm Mle 1938. While its unique gimmick makes it a decent AP option, the lowered reload on every third salvo makes this gun unusable for main fleet compositions where a firing order is required for skill procs. Predominantly used on Littorio for her skill.
 - **[Quadruple 356mm BL](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Quadruple_356mm_(BL_14%22_Mk_VII)#Type_3)** | Both incredibly weak and incredibly slow. Its primary use is as a potentially useful option on King George V, where the accelerated first salvo could prove useful when mobbing or against Siren nodes in events. Additionally, it can be used as a more accessible alternative to the Triple 381mm Prototype BL for monitors who care more about the FP boost than the raw shelling damage of their equipped gun.

 - **[Twin 406mm Drh LC/34 Prototype](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_406mm_(L/52_Drh_LC/34_Prototype))** | Shoots HE shells, uncharacteristic for an Iron Blood gun. It has the highest damage per shell of any HE BB gun, meaning it inflicts the most damaging burn effects on enemies while having a near optimal reload timer in order to maximise burn uptime. It performs well on: battleships with exceptionally high gun efficiencies in order to best take advantage of this burn damage, and battleships who have both strong shelling output and a strong proc-on-fire ability. For fleets that take advantage of timed damage buffs however, this gun's reload timer works against it - as is the case for all guns in this reload bracket.
 - **[Prototype 457mm Twin Mk A](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_457mm_(Mark_A_Prototype))** | Highest base damage per shell in the game - more than 30% higher than the next strongest damage-focused AP gun (Triple 406mm Mle 1938), and also sporting a higher FP bonus due to its rainbow rarity. While its specialised AP shells deal increased damage against all targets compared to other AP guns, they still limit its general usefulness to only against Medium and Heavy targets. This gun should be the absolute strongest AP gun, but falling within the firing band it does is a double-edged sword. Battleships equipped with a strong barrage can also make use of this gun leading to a higher damage potential without sacrificing much gun damage - yet may struggle to take advantage of timed damage buffs and debuffs granted by other ships in the fleet, allowing the Triple 406mm Mle 1939 to pull ahead. Consideration has to be given on a per-fleet basis. 
 - **[Twin 406mm Mk8](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_406mm_(16%22/45_Mk_8))** | The accessible twin barrelled BB AP option. Worse than the Twin 457mm Mk A in every aspect except for reload time and accessibility - but the ease of making one of these compared to a Twin 457mm makes it worthwhile if the timing afforded by twin barrelled BB guns is needed while facing Medium and Heavy targets. However, the burn damage offered by the Twin 406mm Drh can allow it to match (or even exceed) the Mk 8's effectiveness against Med and Hvy targets on ships with high efficiency main gun mounts. Use only if the timing afforded by the gun outweighs the damage potential of alternatives.
 - **[Twin 410mm (3rd Year Type) Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_410mm_(3rd_Year_Type)#Type_3)** | A direct improvement over the Twin 410mm (3rd Year Type) below. Effectively a purple version of the Twin 406mm Drh LC/34, the only things keeping this gun from competing is its lower FP boost and that it can't be improved beyond +11 due to its rarity. A very solid and accessible intermediary option for players that are looking for a twin HE gun.
 - **[Twin 410mm (3rd Year Type)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_410mm_(3rd_Year_Type)#Type_3)** | A more readily accessible alternative to the Twin 406mm Drh LC/34. Nearly identical attributes, but a lower FP bonus thanks to its purple rarity and a negligibly slower fire rate.

[![283mm Triple](/resources/283mm%20triple%20gr_b.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_283mm_(SK_C/34)#Type_3)

 - **[Twin Prototype 381mm BL MkII](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_381mm_(BL_15%22_Mk_II))** | The fastest firing BB HE main gun. It shines on ships with strong proc-on-fire skills but low efficiency and/or baseline FP stats, and in mob clearing fleets where gun damage isn't a concern.
 - **[Triple 305mm (SK C/39 Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_305mm_(SK_C/39_Prototype)#BB_Variant)** | The middle child between the Twin 381mm Prototype BL  and Twin Prototype 406mm Drh LC/34 in both reload time and alpha damage per volley. It has low alpha damage per shell which makes its burn damage lower than the other two, is slower than the Twin 381mm BL but also doesn’t hit as hard as the Twin 406mm Drh, making it rarely better than either gun. Nevertheless, it has its niche in situations where the increased spread of the triple pattern is desired, in the absence of the other two choices, or on a barrage boat that is not going to be your fire starter.
 - **[Triple 283mm SK C/34](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_283mm_(SK_C/34)#Type_3)** | The absolute fastest firing BB main gun in the game, at the cost of sub-100 alpha damage per shell and BB Normal armour modifiers. Worthless for general use, but has some niche applications where the increase in fire rate is significant enough to make up for its shortcomings, such as when your ships significantly outlevel a given map and clear time is of more importance.

 - **[533mm Quintuple Torpedo Mount Mk IX](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/533mm_Quintuple_Torpedo_Mount_Mk_IX)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** By far the best torpedoes for manual play due to its unique linear launch pattern.  This allows for torpedoes to be launched at range and still reliably land on target, a feat no other torpedo launcher can match. It also lays claim to the highest total damage per torpedo spread amongst all torpedoes. Highly recommended.
 - **[533mm Quintuple Torpedo Mount Mk 17](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/533mm_Quintuple_Torpedo_Mount_Mk_17)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** A direct upgrade to everything the standard 533mm Quintuple Torpedo offers - slightly more damage per torp and a reload that's a fraction of a second faster. Inexpensive to craft material-wise as well, and is considered an Eagle Union equipment which can prove useful for ships that require factional equipment for skills.
 - **[610mm Quadruple Torpedo Mount Kai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/610mm_Quadruple_Torpedo_Mount_Kai)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** A direct upgrade to its predecessor. Both have been superseded in their former niche of having the highest per-salvo torp damage possible by the Mk IX, which also doesn't require the vanguard to ram into the target to ensure all their torpedoes land. This torpedo mount does hold claim to the highest alpha damage per torpedo, however. Plus, both 610mm Torpedo Mounts launch the fastest moving torps in the game. 
 - **[533mm Quintuple Torpedo Mount](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/533mm_Quintuple_Torpedo_Mount#Type_3)** | Highest volume of fire, average reload speed, and high alpha damage amongst all non-Gear Lab options, making them the first pick for general use on both auto and manual play. The accessibility of this torpedo mount and its use as a base equipment for upgrade in the Gear Lab makes it the go-to option. 
 - **[610mm Quadruple Torpedo Mount](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/610mm_Quadruple_Torpedo_Mount#Type_3)** | Has the highest alpha damage of all non-Gear Lab torpedoes. Their long reload speed and low volume of fire makes missing with these torpedoes incredibly punishing, and as such, they're poorly suited for auto play. Together with the Gear Lab exclusive Quadruple 610mm Torpedo Mount Kai, this mount launches the fastest moving torpedoes in the game. Previously the go-to for manual but since superseded by Gear Lab torpedoes above - namely the Mk IX.
 - **[533mm Quintuple Homing Torpedo Mount](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/533mm_Quintuple_Homing_Torpedo_Mount#Type_3)** | Sacrifices reload speed and damage for a mild homing effect and gives the highest torpedo bonus of any torpedo mount. They have solid performance on auto and have niche use on manual, when either the homing effect or stat boost are desired. [*Older players had the opportunity to obtain a copy from Divergent Chessboard's Event Shop on both the original run and rerun.]
 - **[533mm Quadruple Torpedo Mount](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/533mm_Quadruple_Torpedo_Mount#Type_3)** | Has the same base torpedo damage as their quintuple counterpart and a significantly faster reload speed, but have a lower stat bonus and only launch four torpedoes per volley. Mostly used to stagger torpedo volleys on auto, or as a transitional equip until stronger torpedo mounts can be acquired.
 - **[533mm Quadruple Homing Torpedo Mount](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/533mm_Quadruple_Homing_Torpedo_Mount#Type_3)** | A significantly weaker version of the quintuple homing mount. While they fire at a comparable speed to the 533mm Quintuple Torpedo Mount and have a homing effect, they're severely held back by their low damage per torpedo and low volume of fire. Functionally poor in manual play where torpedo strikes are used for high burst damage potential, but offer some benefit when used on auto.
 - **[550mm Triple Torpedo Mount](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/550mm_Triple_Torpedo_Launcher#Type_3)** | Occupy the unique niche of having the fastest reload speed of any relevant torpedo launcher. However, while they have high base damage, the fact that they only launch three torpedoes per volley cuts significantly into both alpha damage and volume of fire, on top of being exceedingly difficult to acquire.

**Submarine Torpedoes** <br/>

**About Submarine Torpedoes:** As all submarine torpedo launchers in this list are the same rarity with the same stat bonus, they contribute the same amount to a submarine's combat power rating which is the primary factor in the potency of roaming submarines' HP reduction effect. As such, the difference between the these torpedoes are only relevant when planning to call submarines into live combat - in which case, the homing effect of Bidder and G7e torpedoes make them much more reliable than alternatives despite the comparatively low alpha damage.

 - **[Submarine-mounted Mark 20S "Bidder" Torpedo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Submarine-mounted_Mark_20S_%22Bidder%22_Torpedo)** | **GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** These submarine torpedoes fire three torpedoes per reload cycle, and therefore only require 1 reload cycle to match the torpedo output of 2 G7e reload cycles. As such, they have a significantly lower OXY and RLD requirement and come with a homing effect (albeit weaker than the G7e's). Highly recommended, only hampered by the required prerequisite torpedo (Mark VIII) being locked behind SOS Map Drops and Submarine Weekly Missions. 
 - **[G7e Acoustic Homing Torpedoes](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Submarine-mounted_G7e_Acoustic_Homing_Torpedo#Type_3)** | Have a similar homing effect to their fellow Iron Blood surface counterparts, but still deal competitive damage while reloading faster than most other viable submarine torpedoes. Given the linear, targeted nature of submarine-launched torpedoes, the homing effect of G7e torpedoes gives them the best overall reliability.
 - **[Submarine Mounted Mk16 Torpedoes](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Submarine-mounted_Mark_16_Torpedo#Type_3)** | Have the longest reload speed, but also launch three torpedoes per volley instead of two, and have the highest base torpedo damage. Mk16 torpedoes would be the best choice against stationary targets, but they generally require submarines to have extended combat time in order to offset their long reload time.
 - **[Submarine Type 95 Oxygen Torpedoes](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Submarine-mounted_Type_95_Oxygen_Torpedo#Type_3)** | Offer slightly increased damage compared to the G7e, but trade the homing effect for drastically increased torpedo velocity. Overall, this does less to assist torpedo accuracy than the homing effect, and the difference in velocity between T95 torpedoes and other submarine torpedoes can cause issues with torpedo targeting that cut harshly into damage dealt.

**About Fighters:** For fighters, their armaments are split into both their equipped AA guns and any payload that they may have. One will therefore need to look at a given plane's loadout to see what bombs, if any, it is equipped with. For general use, fighters with bomb payloads are preferred due to their ability to contribute surface damage to the fight. The vast majority of preferable fighters are equipped with either 2x 500lb bombs or 2x 1000lb bombs.
 
 - **[F7F Tigercat](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Grumman_F7F_Tigercat)** | **GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** The most accessible fighter with a 2x 1000lb T0 payload. Flies slower than the Sea Hornet and has a negligibly longer reload time as well. Since these planes can be upgraded directly from existing F6F Hellcats without an intermediary fighter, they're the preferred choice to craft between the two due to the reduced material cost for effectively the same PvE performance.
 - **[Sea Hornet](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/De_Havilland_Sea_Hornet)** | **GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** Tied with the F7F Tigercat as the highest surface damage fighter owing to their unique 2x 1000lb T0 bombs which do more damage while only being 0.4s slower than the previous strongest fighter, the VF-17 Squadron. Primarily chosen over the F7F for niche airstrike timing adjustments where the F7F may not function. [*Older players had the opportunity to obtain a copy from Aurora Noctis' Event Shop.]
 - **[Bf-109G](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Messerschmitt_Bf_109G_(Carrier-based_Prototype))** | The only fighter whose payloads aren't the usual bombs, but rather targeted AP rockets with armour modifiers that allow them to make short work of Light and Medium targets. The rockets are launched in a tight, concentrated burst that rarely miss, making this **the** premier plane against anything that isn't a Heavy target. Its other unique feature is that unlike every other fighter, the Bf-109G will not automatically launch to intercept enemy planes - its AA capabilities are also rather unsatisfactory, especially when compared to other fighters on this list. It makes up for it with sheer, concentrated damage surface damage potential when used against the right targets.
 - **[F4U Corsair (VF-17 Squadron)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Vought_F4U_Corsair_(VF-17_Squadron))** | The fastest fighter amongst the 2x 500lb group, and has unique 500lb T0 bombs with slightly increased base damage over the usual T3 variant. It has relatively weaker anti-air guns, but gives a fleet-wide anti-air boost upon airstrike launch and flies slower, allowing it more time to reload and fire its guns at planes before flying off screen.
 - **[F6F Hellcat](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Grumman_F6F_Hellcat#Type_3)** | Has the strongest interception capabilities of any fighter-bomber. While it is relatively slow to launch, the difference between it and other fighters with the same payload is relatively small and unlikely to have any real impact, making it the strongest general-use fighter. Comparative ease of acquirement further adds to its ubiquity.
 - **[Shiden Kai Ni](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Kawanishi_N1K3-A_Shiden_Kai_2)** | An upgraded Reppuu with improved anti-aircraft interception capability. So improved in fact, that its burst damage on launch is the highest of any gold fighter. However, it flies much too fast to make good use of its AA armament, causing it to fly off screen without staying long enough to fire its guns as often.
 - **[Hawker Sea Fury](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Hawker_Sea_Fury)** | Comparable interception to the Hellcat and reloads slightly faster. Its autocannons have a more narrow firing angle (meaning it might miss enemy planes off to its sides) and longer reload speed than the Hellcat's machine guns, but deal slightly increased burst damage. This, paired with the increased flying speed hamper its AA abilities, but its bomb payload matches any other 2x 500lb fighter. 
 - **[A7M Reppuu](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Mitsubishi_A7M_Reppuu#Type_3)** | A very fast (both in terms of flight speed and reload time) fighter. While its bomb loadout makes it perfectly serviceable for PvE, it has certain characteristics that make it predominantly worth using in PvP: its fast speed allows it to bait out enemy anti-air fire, and it deals high crash damage amongst its 2x 500lb payload-bearing peers. 
 - **[Supermarine Seafang](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Supermarine_Seafang#Type_3)** | The last gold rarity fighter with a 2x 500lb payload, and effectively a *marginally* weaker Hawker Sea Fury, albeit more accessible. While it's more than strong enough for general use, it falls behind the other listed planes in certain respects, making it only worth upgrading if lacking other gold rarity fighters.
 - **[Me-155a](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Messerschmitt_Me-155A#Type_3)** | Has no bombs and therefore deals no surface damage, but is the second fastest fighter overall, the fastest gold rarity fighter, and has superior anti-air guns to the Hellcat. Potentially worth using when fighting enemies with heavy aviation presence, especially on carriers with weak fighter slots, but ill-advised on carriers with strong fighter slots who will generally benefit more from a fighter with a bomb payload.
 - **[Fw 190 A-5 (Carrier-based Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Focke-Wulf_Fw_190_A-5_(Carrier-based_Prototype))** | A purple plane with the most hefty anti-aircraft gun ensemble found on any fighter. Like the Me-155 above, carries no bomb payload and therefore does no surface damage, and also has a signficantly slower reload time. Worth mentioning due to the relative ease of crafting and enhancing one, albeit that its use cases are still niche at best.
 - **[F8F Bearcat](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Grumman_F8F_Bearcat)** | **GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** | Despite being an upgrade to the F6F Hellcat in the Gear Lab, this fighter's payload changes to a single 1000lb BC bomb that reduces its surface damage output compared to its predecessor. However, its significantly reduced reload time gives it some use as a reload tuning plane. Ill-advised for most setups due to the material costs involved in its fabrication; most players would be better off simply upgrading their F6F Hellcats to F7F Tigercats instead.
 - **[Zero Fighter Model 52](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Mitsubishi_A6M5_Zero#Type_3)** | A relatively fast reloading fighter that still has *some* form of bomb payload, although its 2x 100lb payload has under half the base damage of the usual 2x 500lb payload and a significantly smaller blast radius. Mostly used for very specific reload tuning setups, similar to the Bearcat above.

 **About Dive Bombers:** Bomb damage does not scale linearly with payload weight, all bomb drops are beholden to the same RNG drop point, and larger bombs only provide a small increase in damage. As such, quantity of bombs is generally preferred to quality of bombs. 
 
 - **[Nakajima J5N Tenrai](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nakajima_J5N_Tenrai_(Dive_Bomber_Prototype))** | **The** strongest dive bomber in the game. Largest total payload potential in the form of 3x 1600lb AP bombs which have a chance to trigger the Armour Break debuff on the target, increasing its damage received from *shelling* by 8% for 6s. 
 - **[XSB3C](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Curtiss_XSB3C_(Experimental))** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** The fabled gold Helldiver, and strongest gold DB in the game. Effectively a SB2C Helldiver with 20 more AVI stat, highly improved fighter-tier autocannons, marginally slower reload and the **exact same** bomb payload. This means that it only gains an appreciable advantage over the SB2C Helldiver when enhanced to +12 or +13. Helldivers will still do perfectly fine for most PvE content.
 - **[SB2C Helldiver](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Curtiss_SB2C_Helldiver#Type_3)** | Also carries the strongest bomb payload of all gold dive bombers by a wide margin, but is also the slowest. Strongest dive bomber for general use, especially on carriers with strong DB slots. Ease of acquirement and enhancement makes it the go-to choice.
 - **[Ju-87c 'Stuka'](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Junkers_Ju-87C#Type_3)** | The only other bomber that can compete with the Helldiver in terms of raw damage potential. It reloads slightly faster, but its 100lb bombs have a small blast radius, which can cut into overall reliability. Used as an intermediary gear when alternatives are unavailable.
 - **[Fairey Firefly](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Firefly)** | Average reload speed with average damage, but its main appeal is its anti-air guns. Equipped with the same autocannons found on Royal fighters, the Firefly is capable of dealing fighter-tier anti-air damage, but as a dive bomber, is incapable of the same automatic interception as a real fighter, its guns only being beneficial after launching a full airstrike. Finds niche use for airstrike reload tuning on carriers with low efficiency DB slots, or on ships with skills that require factional gear.
 - **[Suisei Model 12A](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yokosuka_Suisei_Model_12A)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** A direct upgrade to the D4Y Suisei found below - same bomb payload (albeit marginally improved from T3 to T0 variants) with the fastest reload timing among all gold DBs. The go-to choice for reload tuning situations on carriers with weak DB slots.
 - **[D4Y Suisei 'Comet'](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Yokosuka_D4Y_Suisei#Type_3)** | Has a relatively weak payload, but is the fastest non-Gear Lab dive bomber. Used in reload tuning.
 - **[SBD Dauntless (McClusky)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Douglas_SBD_Dauntless_(McClusky))** | While the base damage of its payload is lower compared to a more damage-focused DB like the SB2C Helldiver, the damage buff against carriers that the plane confers applies to the ship equipped with the plane rather than just the plane itself. Therefore, if pressed for single target burst damage against a carrier boss (e.g 13-4 Taihou), most carriers can make use of this. Especially those that don't have high efficiency DB slots and instead rely on other planes to deal the bulk of their damage.
 - **[Fairey Fulmar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Fulmar#Type_3)** | Effectively a fighter masquerading as a dive bomber. Has anti-aircraft DPS potential that puts some other fighters to shame, but has an awful payload of only 2x 100lb bombs. Easily acquirable and boasts the fastest reload time of any dive bomber in the game however, and is primarily used as a airstrike reload tuner when alternatives aren't available to the player.

**About Torpedo Bombers:** For torpedo bombers, a distinction has to be made between TBs that carry Aerial Torpedoes in their payload, and those that carry Sakura Empire or Iron Blood Aerial Torpedoes. The majority of TBs carry regular Aerial Torpedoes - this payload is dropped in parallel lines towards the target with rather large gaps between each torpedo, resulting in a wide pattern that spreads its damage across the screen. This Parallel pattern is best employed by mobbing fleets or against fast-moving targets. 
Sakura Empire and Iron Blood Aerial Torpedoes are instead dropped in a converging pattern where the torpedoes narrow in to a point, resulting in a pattern that makes it best suited to dealing large amounts of damage to a single target assuming that the target is stationary or otherwise slowed/rooted. It is up to the player to make the deliberation as to which TB type - Parallel or Converging - is best suited for the content they are facing with the ships and equipment they have on hand.

 - **[B7A Ryuusei](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Aichi_B7A_Ryuusei#Type_3)** | {Converging} | Launches torpedoes that converge on a point rather than in a parallel spread. While typically used for its superior damage capabilities against bosses where all torpedoes will hit the target, Ryuusei can be a strong general use torpedo bomber. If it misses its intended target, the torpedoes will fan out, similar to a torpedo volley launched by surface ships, and are still capable of hitting auxiliary targets.
 - **[Ju-87 D-4](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Junkers_Ju-87_D-4)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** {Converging} | The only Iron Blood torpedo bomber in the game. The torpedoes dropped by this TB also converge on their target, but do so in a manner that makes their hit rate against fast-moving enemies better than the Ryuusei's. This improved hit rate makes up for their slightly lowered alpha damage per torpedo, and their marginally faster reload time makes them a useful option for airstrike reload tuning without giving up the single-target damage that Converging TBs have. Effectively an Iron Blood Ryuusei.
 - **[Westland Wyvern](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Westland_Wyvern)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** {Parallel} | Drops 4 highly damaging Aerial Torpedoes in a Parallel pattern per plane, and is the only non-Fighter plane in the game capable of being launched for interception against enemy plane waves by carriers. Adds a lot to the AA damage potential of any carrier in the game, and also hits extremely hard. Primarily used in mobbing situations and where the added anti-air prowess helps to maintain the stealth of ships involved. Also seen in PvP where its insanely high crash damage is used to full effect.
 - **[XTB2D-1 Skypirate](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Douglas_XTB2D-1_Skypirate)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** {Parallel} | The only other torpedo bomber in the game capable of dropping 4 torpedoes per plane, and also does so in a Parallel pattern. Niche use in mobbing situations but often times a Barracuda does the job, and does it without being locked behind the Gear Lab.
 - **[Fairey Swordfish (818 Squadron)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Swordfish_(818_Squadron))** | {Parallel} | Weaker than the Barracuda in damage per torpedo, but has the unique ability to slow enemies hit by its torpedoes. While weaker than a Barracuda if your fleet is incapable of capitalising on the slow-down effect, the utility it provides can be incredibly powerful when paired with battleships. Predominantly used against bosses that move too fast for a Ryuusei to be reliable.
 - **[TBM Avenger (VT-18 Squadron)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/TBM_Avenger_(VT-18_Squadron))** | {Parallel} | Strongest individual torpedoes of any non-rainbow TB (with the exception of the VT-8 below). Comes with a skill that boosts the equipped CV's damage against BBs/BCs by 3% and has a 60% chance to cause flooding on hit. Perfect for mobbing and overtakes Barracuda since BBs/BCs are often seen and the slower reload rarely matters.
 - **[B6N2 Tenzan Model 12A](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nakajima_B6N2_Tenzan_Model_12A)** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** {Converging} | Carries the exact torpedo payload as a Ryuusei and can be upgraded into one via the Gear Lab for additional AVI stat boosts and the option to be enhanced to +13. Incredibly capable intermediary TB choice in the meanwhile. 
 - **[B6N Tenzan](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nakajima_B6N_Tenzan#Type_3)** | {Converging} | Strict downgrade to the Ryuusei but far more more accessible. Performs very well at its role, and can be upgraded into the Tenzan Model 12A through the Gear Lab.
 - **[Nakajima C6N Saiun (Model 21 Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Nakajima_C6N_Saiun_(Model_21_Prototype))** | {Convering} | Simultaneously the fastest flying torpedo bomber in the game while also being the fastest reloading of all Converging pattern torpedo bombers. However, while each of its torpedoes hit harder than its primary competiton (Ryuusei and Ju-87 D-4), each plane carries only 2 torpedoes rather than the usual 3. The result - a Converging pattern torpedo bomber that loses in damage potential to the other two in exchange for faster reload speed. Generally unfavourable compared to the more easily obtainable (and stronger payload-bearing) options above, but sees possible use in specific reload tuning compositions or where the faster flight speed, and therefore quickened payload delivery time, may be desirable. 
 - **[Fairey Barracuda](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Barracuda#Type_3)** | {Parallel} | A relatively fast, parallel spread torpedo bomber with no real stand-out characteristics. Predominantly used for mob clearing, especially on carriers with weak torpedo bombers. Fairly easy to acquire from Tech Packs.
 - **[Torpedo Squadron 8 (VT-8)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Torpedo_Squadron_8_(VT-8))** | {Parallel} | Very unique piece of equipment. It launches incredibly weak TBD Devastators for the first airstrike launched by its equipped carrier. However, for every subsequent airstrike, the Devastators are replaced with unique TBF Avengers which have the highest base damage of any parallel torpedo bomber. Technically usable in boss fights where the first, weaker airstrike often goes out against mob units - but many other equally capable alternatives exist that don't cost Core Data to obtain.
 - **[Fairey Albacore](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Fairey_Albacore#Type_3)** | {Parallel} | The fastest torpedo bomber and deals the same damage per torpedo as the Barracuda, but launches 1 fewer torpedo per plane and sacrifices some AVI boost due to its lower rarity. Given the nature of parallel torpedoes, the loss of one per plane represents a much lower loss in actual damage output relative to the loss in total potential damage. Use with care. *Note about Formidable's Barrage: only use this when mobbing. Against singular targets (as when up against boss ndoes) Ryuusei's full payload is much more damaging when accompanied with her skill's slowing effect.*

## Anti-Air (AA) Guns
 Anti-air damage is based off of the AA capabilities and equipment placed on all participating ships in the fleet, where every ship equipped with AA guns contributes damage based off their AA stat and efficiency, with the reload and range of the fleet's AA circle being based on the average reload speed and range of all guns in the fleet. As such, there are two main roles for AA guns: damage and acceleration. Due to the limited window of time your fleet has to deal anti-air damage, your main goal with an anti-air setup is to maximise the number of damage ticks, and then maximise the damage per tick. A player will generally equip a purely damage focused gun on whoever has the highest effective AA in their fleet and equip accelerators on every ship with weak effective AA, and pad out damage as necessary by equipping guns with preferable damage and reload (such as the Quadruple 40mm Bofors) on ships with above median effective AA.<br/><br/>In practice, the difference between a fully optimised AA setup and one that uses functional gold rarity guns that the player has access to is minimal. Anti-air damage does not win battles; surface damage wins battles.

 - **[Sextuple 40mm Bofors](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Sextuple_40mm_Bofors)** | The strongest AA gun the game presently has by a *wide* margin. The go-to damage centric AA gun, the only demerit to which is its shorter range compared to alternatives - a problem easily resolved by mixing other guns with a larger range into the fleet where necessary. There is *no* reason not to give this to the ship with the highest effective AA in your fleet.
 - **[Twin 90mm AA (Model 1939 Prototype)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_90mm_AA_(Model_1939_Prototype))** | A direct upgrade to the Quadruple 40mm Bofors below. Same base damage, same effective reload speed, more range. Supersedes the Quadruple Bofors as the superior mono-gun AA choice.
 - **[Quadruple 40mm Bofors](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Quadruple_40mm_L60_Mk2_Bofors#Type_3)** | Capable of filling the niche of both an accelerator and damage AA gun, and forms the foundation of a strong AA setup. While a mix of different types of AA guns will always provide the most gains, a setup that uses exclusively quad Bofors will be stronger than any other mono-gun setup - unless that gun happens to be the Twin 90mm above. 
 - **[Octuple 40mm Pom-Pom](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Octuple_40mm_Pom-Pom#Type_3)** | One of the strongest damage-focused AA guns with a relatively fast reload speed. While it has a low base range, as range is calculated based on the average range of all AA guns in your fleet, this is generally a non-concern unless you're attempting to utilise more than one Pom-Pom.
 - **[Twin 113mm (QF Mk I)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_113mm_(4.5%22/45_QF_Mk_I)#Type_3)** | Very high base damage and largest range, but it also has a relatively long reload speed. This gun has potential to be incredibly powerful when used responsibly, but poor usage will only cut into your fleet's AA tick rate, providing very little tangible benefits.
 - **[Twin 134mm High-Angle (QF Mk I)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_134mm_High-Angle_(QF_Mk_I))** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** Marginally higher base damage than the Twin 113mm QF, but with the longest reload time of any AA gun. Generally less useful as an actual anti-aircraft weapon due to its obscenely long reload time, but it does give a small boost to FP and is the *only* AA gun to do so. More commonly used in situations where planes are not actually a concern and the surface damage potential of gun-reliant vanguard units is instead maximised by virtue of the FP boost. Primarily equipped on gunDDs with high main gun coefficients, but appreciable on all hull types. [*Older players had the opportunity to obtain a copy from the Fight On, Royal Maids! event.]
 - **[Twin 100mm High-Angle (Type 98)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_100mm_High-Angle_(Type_98))** and **[105mm Twin SK C/33](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_105mm_(SK_C/33)#Type_3)** | Strong guns if you lack other gold AA guns, but have lower damage than both the Twin 113mm QF and Octuple 40mm Pom-Pom, making them suboptimal in all scenarios.

[![37mm Twin ACAD](/resources/37mm%20twin%20acad%20gr_a.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_37mm_ACAD_Mle_1936)

 - **[Twin 40mm Bofors STAAG](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_40mm_Bofors_STAAG_Mk_II)** | Relatively slow for an accelerator gun, but it brings high base damage and long range. The STAAG also gives a bonus to HIT, making it the de facto strongest AA gun for ships with lower base HIT (and therefore lowered accuracy) when actual AA damage is a non-concern. Generally speaking, battleships have higher priority for this gun than others owing to how well they can utilise the extra HIT stat.
 - **[Triple 25mm AA (Type 96 Blast Shield)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Triple_25mm_AA_(Type_96_Blast_Shield))** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** *The* fastest gold AA gun in the game, but with the poorest range among its gold accelerator peers as well. Best used on ships with incredibly poor AA but high RLD to take full advantage of its strengths, especially where an additional AA tick can be achieved on a given wave of planes.
  - **[Twin 76mm AA (Mk 27 Mount)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_76mm_AA_(Mk_27_Mount))** | **[GEAR LAB EXCLUSIVE EQUIPMENT]** A direct improvement to the Twin 40mm Bofors Type 98 found below. Improved range and base damage while having the same effective reload, only held back by its ridiculous material requirement of 45 Military-Grade Electronic Components per crafted copy. Usually best spent elsewhere.
 - **[Twin 40mm Bofors Type 98](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_40mm_Bofors_High-Angle_Type_98)** | While it lacks the accuracy boost of the STAAG, the Type 98 makes up for it by shooting even faster, making it the fastest reloading non-Gear Lab gold AA gun in the game. Best used on ships who have low effective AA but whose base accuracy is high enough that the accuracy boost of the STAAG would be wasted - basically any vanguard unit with low effective AA. 
 - **[Twin 40mm Bofors Hazemeyer Mount](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_40mm_Bofors_Hazemeyer_Mount_Mk_IV)** and **[Twin 37mm ACAD Mle1936](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Twin_37mm_ACAD_Mle_1936)** | Simply weaker variants of the STAAG and Type 98 Bofors respectively. The Hazemeyer mount is the predecessor to the STAAG mount, and while it shares the same niche, it shoots marginally slower and has half the HIT boost. Similarly, the French Twin 37mm ACAD fills the same niche as the Bofors Type 98, but it is weaker in every respect. Still usable guns given the rarity of research equipment, but suboptimal.
