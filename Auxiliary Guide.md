# Auxiliary Equipment Guide
For information on other equipment see the [In-Depth PVE Equipment Guide.](/Equipment%20Guide.md)

This guide for auxiliary equipment is split off from the rest due to the relative depth variety of auxiliary equipment setups. Equipment will not be graded in this guide.

## Defensive Auxiliary Equipment
**Standard Defensive Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Improved Hydraulic Rudder](/resources/improved%20hydraulic%20rudder%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Hydraulic_Rudder)
[![Beaver Badge](/resources/beaver%20badge%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Little_Beaver_Squadron_Tag)

[![Gamer's Mark](/resources/Gamers%20Mark.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Gamers_Mark)
[![Celestial Body](/resources/Celestial%20Body%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Celestial_Body)
[![Goldburn](/resources/Goldburn.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Goldburn#Type_0)
[![Fuel Filter](/resources/fuel%20filter%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fuel_Filter#Type_3)
[![Naval Camo](/resources/naval%20camo%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Naval_Camouflage)
[![Hydraulic Rudder](/resources/hydraulic%20rudder%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Hydraulic_Steering_Gear)
[![Shimapan Camo](/resources/Shimapan%20Camo.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Ocean_Soul_Camouflage)

 - **[Improved Hydraulic Rudder](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Hydraulic_Rudder)** is the strongest evasion-focused aux. In addition to having the strongest raw EVA stat boost from a defensive standpoint, this rudder has a 30% chance every 20s to evade all attacks for 2 seconds. **Limited to one per ship.**
 
 - **[Beaver Squadron Badge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Little_Beaver_Squadron_Tag)** provides a similar, but slightly weaker EVA stat boost to the Improved Rudder. However, it trades the rudder's emergency evasion skill for a permanent fleet-wide speed boost. While the speed boost is only relevant for the vanguard, the boost is active regardless of where the badge is equipped. Due to the one Rudder limits on ship, it makes this is the best 2nd-slot evasion gear on units that desperately need it (e.g most CAs, BBs in PvP).

 - **[Repair Kit/Toolbox](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Repair_Toolkit#Type_3)** has the 2nd highest raw HP boost and slowly restores the equipped ship's HP over time. The heal-over-time from the repair kit can, in certain scenarios, make up for the repair kit providing a weaker raw eHP boost. While the repair kit is not limited per ship, the heal from only a single repair kit can be in effect.

 - **[Cosmic Kicks/Heels](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Cosmic_Kicks)** has the 3rd highest EVA stat boost in the game and has a 5 speed as a side bonus. Primarily used on on units that can make the most of both qualities: most Heavy Cruisers.
 
 - **[Pyoko-Pyoko/Headband](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Pyoko-Pyoko)** provides the same HP boost as the repair kit, but trades the heal-over-time for a minor LCK boost. While the LCK increase is incredibly small, because the heal from multiple repair kits cannot stack the Pyoko-Pyoko becomes an optimal replacement for a repair kit when equipped to a ship who would otherwise gain the highest eHP boost from equipping two auxiliary equips that give this level of HP boost.
 
 - **[Seal of the Four Gods](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Seal_of_the_Four_Gods)** has the highest raw HP boost for Destroyers in the game and increases the barrage damage of the four ROC DDs by 50% as well as changing the barrage's colour. Limited to only Destroyers. While the HP difference is small, it is relevant nonetheless for the same reasons as the Pyoko-Pyoko above.
 
 - **[Gamer's Mark](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Gamers_Mark)** and **[Celestial Body](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Celestial_Body)** provides the same raw HP boost as Seal of the Four Gods but is not limited to only Destroyers. Meaning, ships that may value the HP boost (e.g Ryuuhou, CL/CAs in specific situations, 0LB ships) can also make good use of it.
 
  - **[Goldburn](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Goldburn#Type_0)** is similar to the Gamer's Mark and Celestial Body above but with the added bonus of giving 38 RLD if equipped by a Vanguard or SSSS Collab ship, making it a dual purpose auxiliary that boosts survivability and offensive output.
 
 - **[Fuel Filter](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fuel_Filter#Type_3)** gives a moderate boost to HP and a small boost to EVA, while also having no bonus skill effect. While it is suboptimal in nearly every situation, it is still useful as transitional equipment.
 
 - **[Naval Camo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Naval_Camouflage)** and **[Hydraulic Rudder](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Hydraulic_Steering_Gear)** provide the exact same stat boosts with no bonus skill effect, with a focus on boosting EVA. Despite their low rarity, they are the most cost-effective evasion-focused auxiliary equips after the Improved Rudder and Beaver Badge and are not limited to just copy per ship.

 - **[Ocean Soul Camo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Ocean_Soul_Camouflage)** provides 1 more EVA and 56 HP over Naval Camo and Hydraulic Rudder but at the cost of 800 Core Data as well as extra T3 Auxiliary Plates and Gold. A waste of core data.

**Speed Boosting Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Gyroscope](/resources/gyroscope%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Gyroscope#Type_3)
[![Boiler](/resources/boiler%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Boiler#Type_3)

 - **[Gyroscope](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Gyroscope#Type_3)** and **[Improved Boiler](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Boiler#Type_3)** both provide a movement speed boost, with the gyroscope providing a high accuracy boost and the boiler providing a minor HP boost. In general, the ships that would value the speed boost will value the accuracy boost of the gyroscope over the boiler's HP boost. Due to speed being the most effective strategy in PvP, they are a mainstay there along with the Beaver Squadron Badge.

**Specialty Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Fire Extinguisher](/resources/fire%20extinguisher%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fire_Extinguisher)
[![Anti-Air Radar](/resources/anti-air%20radar%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/High_Performance_Anti-Air_Radar)
[![Repair Crane](/resources/repair%20crane%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Ship_Maintenance_Crane#Type_3)
[![Torpedo Bulge](/resources/torpedo%20bulge%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Anti-Torpedo_Bulge#Type_3)
[![Pearl Tears](/resources/pearl%20tears%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Pearl_Tears)
[![VH Armor Plating](/resources/VH%20Armor%20Plating%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/VH_Armor_Plating)

 - **[Fire Extinguisher](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fire_Extinguisher)** provides a moderate boost to HP and reduces the chances of a ship catching fire, reduces burn damage received from said fire, *and* reduces the duration of burn effects. Almost mandatory in story and event maps where burn damage poses a significant risk to sinking your flagship.
 
 - **[High-Performance Anti-Air Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/High_Performance_Anti-Air_Radar)** increases AA stat. Aside from increasing anti-air damage dealt, the AA stat also reduces crash damage received by the main fleet when enemy airplanes make it to the left end of the screen. Also reduces the likelihood of encountering Ambush/Airstrikes by 12%, similar to the SG radar (see below); does not stack with SG radar.
 
 - **[Repair Crane](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Ship_Maintenance_Crane#Type_3)** can only be equipped on repair ships (ARs). Every 5s, it heals the most damaged ship in the fleet for a flat 15 HP. Does not stack with non-MLB ARs passive heal. 
 
 - **[Anti-Torpedo Bulge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Anti-Torpedo_Bulge#Type_3)** provides a moderate boost to HP and reduces damage received from torpedoes. Does not apply to damage from torpedo bombers.
 
 - **[Pearl Tears](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Pearl_Tears)** provides an equivalent HP boost to the repair kit, but trades the heal-over-time for a fleet-wide heal when the equipped ship sinks. Useful when powerleveling low-level ships and especially useful in PvP.

 - **[VH Armour Plating](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/VH_Armor_Plating)** provides the highest raw HP boost in the game for Battleships, Battlecruisers, Aviation Battleships, Aircraft Carriers and Large Cruisers as well as reducing damage taken from all ammo types on a Heavy armoured ship. Furthermore, changes a ship's armour type to Heavy if the ship's armour isn't Heavy. Useful for specific backliners with %HP self-healing capabilities or paired with Vestal against AP damage source in event maps, or on a particular frontline Large Cruiser. Limited usage in normal maps due to backline ships having either more appropiate defensive equipment for the situation or simply prefer offensive options.

## Offensive Auxiliary Equipment
**Vanguard Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Oxytorp](/resources/oxytorp%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_93_Pure_Oxygen_Torpedo)
[![533mm Magnetic Torpedo](/resources/533mm%20Magnetic%20Torpedo%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/533mm_Magnetic_Torpedo)
[![Autoloader](/resources/autoloader%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Autoloader#Type_3)
[![FCR](/resources/fcr%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fire_Control_Radar#Type_3)
[![FuMO 25](/resources/FuMO.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Funkmess-Ortung_25_Radar)
[![Battle Tractro Max](/resources/BattleTractoMax.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Battle_Tracto_Max#Type_0)
[![FP Report](/resources/FP%20Report.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Intel_Report-Arctic_Stronghold)

 - **[Type 93 Oxygen Torpedo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_93_Pure_Oxygen_Torpedo)** has the highest TRP stat boost with a moderate RLD boost. For most ships equipped with torpedoes, it will provide a higher boost to their effective damage than any other aux. However, as this is reliant on your torpedoes actively hitting targets, other auxiliaries may provide a superior effective boost to their DPS.
 
 - **[533mm Magnetic Torpedo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/533mm_Magnetic_Torpedo)** has a decent TRP boost with an average accuracy boost coupled with a unique skill to make the 1st torpedo salvo launched by the equipped ship to have a homing effect as well as increasing that salvo's damage by 5%. Very potent in PvP torpedo vanguards and great for Siren nuking since most ships come equipped with a preloaded torp salvo to enable them to use the best nuking torp mount without worrying about manual gameplay.
 
 - **[Automated Reloader](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Autoloader#Type_3)** has a very high RLD boost with a mild FP boost. It is generally used for manipulating reload timings in niche situations, or as an intermediary damage boosting aux for gunCAs.
 
 - **[Fire Control Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fire_Control_Radar#Type_3)** provides moderate boosts to FP and HIT. Of the vanguard units, it can only be equipped to Heavy Cruisers. It generally pulls ahead of the reloader if the accuracy boost is valuable or the equipped ship has strong firepower boosts.
 
 - **[FuMO 25](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Funkmess-Ortung_25_Radar)** similar to the Fire Control Radar above, but provides more FP and HIT while also being equippable by Light Cruisers. The premier damage boosting aux for any gun-focused vanguard unit.
 
 - **[Battle Tracto Max](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Battle_Tracto_Max#Type_0)** provides FP and EVA, and is the premier FP boosting auxiliary for gun-focused Destroyers due to their lack of access to both the Fire Control Radar and Fumo 25. 

 - **[Arctic Report/FP Report](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Intel_Report-Arctic_Stronghold)** provides moderate boosts to FP and HP. Useful for FP stacking on Destroyers, and damage reduction from Siren enemies in Operation Siren.

**Gunnery Main Fleet Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![AFCT](/resources/AFCT.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Admiralty_Fire_Control_Table)
[![T1 Shell](/resources/t1%20shell%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_1_Armor_Piercing_Shell)
[![SH Shell](/resources/sh%20shell%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Super_Heavy_Shell)
[![HPFCR](/resources/hpfcr%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/High_Performance_Fire_Control_Radar)
[![T98 FDD](/resources/t98%20fdd%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_98_Delayed_Firing_Device)
[![T91 Shell](/resources/t91%20shell%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_91_Armor_Piercing_Shell)

 - **[Admiralty Fire Control Table](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Admiralty_Fire_Control_Table)** is an improved variant of the HPFCR below. Has identical first shelling cooldown reduction, also has significantly improved HIT boost, and additional reduction of main gun spread by 2 for the BB that has it equipped. 
 *Note that only one AFCT or HPFCR can be equipped on a ship at any one time. They cannot both be equipped simultaneously.*

 - **[Type 1 Armour-Piercing Shell](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_1_Armor_Piercing_Shell)** provides a high FP boost and mild HIT boost. Additionally, it increases the damage dealt by any critical hit by a flat 25% value. The accuracy boost gives it a strong advantage over other FP-boosting auxiliaries.
 
 - **[Super-Heavy Shell](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Super_Heavy_Shell)** has a very high FP boost and increases shelling critical chance by 8%. While the lack of an HIT boost makes it weaker overall than the Type 1 Armour-Piercing Shell, not being able to stack equipment skill effects means both shells used in a pair will generally be the highest damage boost for a battleship. 
 
 - **[High-Performance Fire Control Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/High_Performance_Fire_Control_Radar)** has stats similar but slightly superior to the standard FCR. It also reduces the reload time of the first round of shelling by 15%. Unlike the standard FCR, HPFCR cannot be equipped to heavy cruisers. Used on BBs for the reload reduction and appreciable FP and HIT stats. 
 *Note that only one AFCT or HPFCR can be equipped on a ship at any one time. They cannot both be equipped simultaneously.*
 
 - **[Type 98 Firing Delay Device](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_98_Delayed_Firing_Device)** provides a moderate firepower boost and reduces the main gun's spread. It's similar in function to a fire control radar, trading the stat-based HIT boost for a physical accuracy boost to shells' spread radius in-game. Generally not worth using over other offensive aux.
 
 - **[Type 91 Armour-Piercing Shell](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_91_Armor_Piercing_Shell)** provides the same stats and skill effect as the Type 1 Armour-Piercing Shell, but is weaker in potency and can be acquired from Sakura Empire Tech Packs. Less practical than other budget alternatives due to its lack of repurposability once replacements have been acquired, but functional nonetheless.
 
 - **[Automated Reloader](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Autoloader)** and **[Fire Control Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fire_Control_Radar)** can be used as budget alternatives to the auxiliaries listed above and are more easily repurposed than the Type 91 Armour-Piercing Shell thanks to their ability to be equipped to vanguard ships.

**Aviation Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Catapult](/resources/catapult%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Steam_Catapult#Type_3)
[![Homing Beacon](/resources/homing%20beacon%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Homing_Beacon)
[![Jet Fuel](/resources/av%20gas%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/100/150_Aviation_Gasoline)

 - **[Steam Catapult](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Steam_Catapult#Type_3)** provides the highest raw AVI boost and a minor HP boost.
 
 - **[Homing Beacon](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Homing_Beacon)** provides a moderate AVI boost, but reduces the reload timer of all airstrikes on the equipped ship by 4%. While not a large amount, this allows buff-oriented carriers to equip higher base damage planes instead of faster reloading alternatives with a lower damage potential while still aligning their airstrikes with other sources of burst damage. Or, just general reload tuning for auto play. Also useful in clearing fleets where getting damage out faster is often preferable to dealing more damage. 
 
 - **[100/150 Aviation Fuel](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/100/150_Aviation_Gasoline)** has a moderate AVI boost, and increases the HP and the flight speed of launched aircraft. Generally a PvP aux, as the plane HP increase does nothing in PvE (note: AA ships in PvE act like a curtain that kills plane when they pass through, ignoring plane HP entirely and can only be dodged by the planes' evasion), but the flight speed increase gives it potential niche usage (e.g on Formidable).

## Miscellaneous Auxiliary Equipment
**Accuracy Boosting Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![SG Radar](/resources/sg%20radar%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/SG_Radar#Type_3)
[![Resplendent Astrum](/resources/Resplendent%20Astrum%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Resplendent_Astrum)
[![Sacred Lumière](/resources/Sacred%20Lumière%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Sacred_Lumi%C3%A8re)
[![White-Hot Verheerender](/resources/White-Hot%20Verheerender%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/White-Hot_Verheerender)
[![RWG](/resources/rwg%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Random_Word_Generator)
[![Team Emblem](/resources/Team%20Emblem.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Team_Emblem)
[![T94 Director](/resources/t94%20director%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_94_High_Angle_Director)

 - **[SG Radar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/SG_Radar#Type_3)** has a split of EVA and HIT, making it the only true hybrid offensive/defensive aux. More importantly, the SG radar improves your chances of evading ambushes as well as decreasing the encounter rate; does not stack with the high-performance AA radar (see above) and Catalina (see below). While slightly weaker than the Naval Camo in terms of raw eHP, the accuracy boost and ambush evasion make SG radars a generally more useful aux. The changes to the ambush system have since taken away much of its primary usage potential in decreasing ambush chances when clearing story maps.
 
 - **[Resplendent Astrum](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Resplendent_Astrum)**, **[Sacred Lumière](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Sacred_Lumi%C3%A8re)** and **[White-Hot Verheerender](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/White-Hot_Verheerender)** are the 3 mics, identically giving 30 HIT and 35 AA. They are currently the strongest accuracy-boosting auxiliary equipment for carriers, but the usefulness of that added HIT over alternatives is debatable.
 
 - **[Random Word Generator](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Random_Word_Generator)** and **[Team Emblem](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Team_Emblem)** provides a similar statline to the SG radar, but with a slightly lower HIT boost and without the ambush evasion effect. They are currently the 2nd strongest accuracy-boosting piece of equipment for carriers, as they cannot equip the SG Radar or Gyroscope.
 
 - **[Type 94 High-Angle Director](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_94_High_Angle_Director)** has a moderate boost to AA and a mild boost to HIT. Generally not useful as a more dedicated piece of equipment will provide a far more potent boost to either of those stats while also bringing a bonus skill effect.

**Submarine Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Oxytorp](/resources/oxytorp%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_93_Pure_Oxygen_Torpedo)
[![Snorkel](/resources/snorkel%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Snorkel)
[![Battery](/resources/battery%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Storage_Battery)
[![Pressure-Resistant Hull Design](/resources/Sub%20Hull%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Pressure-Resistant_Hull_Design)

 - **[Type 93 Oxygen Torpedo](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Type_93_Pure_Oxygen_Torpedo)** is the preferred TRP boosting auxiliary equipment coupled with a moderate RLD boost. Its rainbow rarity provides a higher Combat Power boost than gold rarity equipment - and as this affects roaming submarines' damage dealt to targets, is still utilised in that use-case.
 
 - **[Improved Snorkel](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Snorkel)** boosts the O2 stat of the equipped submarine, increasing the amount of time they can stay submerged. While not directly offensive, it enables certain submarines to fire off an extra volley with their equipped torpedoes, which provides a greater increase in damage than the large TRP stat boost of an oxytorp. Only one oxygen-increasing aux can be equipped per submarine.
 
 - **[Improved Storage Battery](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Storage_Battery)** provides a mild EVA boost and increases a submarine's hunting range by up to 2 levels (at +10). Only functions when equipped to the submarine fleet's flagship. As meowfficers can provide the same increase in hunting range while also boosting stats and not coming with the opportunity cost of occupying an aux slot, the battery is generally not worth investing in but is useful in one specific instance where you can run a 0LB sub as flag to have the best possible range while costing very little for levelling other subs.
 
 - **[Pressure-Resistant Hull Design](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Pressure-Resistant_Hull_Design)** provides a small TRP boost and a small HP boost, which by themselves are inferior to other available auxes. What is special about it is its skill - "Increases a submarine's Speed by 20% and moves it forward another 8 units after it enters battle". The 20% speed increase makes the submarine get into its new position at around the same time it would its unboosted one, and the 8 unit forward positioning makes it so the submarines are always in range to shoot at high priority targets on screen. The result - a direct damage increase compared to when they were hanging back much further and can't obtain a target. Highly recommended.

**Ship-Specific Auxiliaries**<br/>
[![Z Flag](/resources/z%20flag%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Z_Flag)
[![Promise](/resources/promise%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Unfulfilled_Promise)
[![Cat Punch](/resources/cat%20punch%20no_gr.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Healing_Cat%27s_Paw)
[![Catalina](/resources/Catalina.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Consolidated_PBY-5A_Catalina)
[![Kolibri Helicopter](/resources/Koln%20Heli.png)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Flettner_Fl_282_Kolibri)

 - **[Z Flag](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Z_Flag)** when equipped to Mikasa, provides similar stats to an SG radar, but trades the ambush evasion bonus for a fleet-wide FP and HIT boost.
 
 - **[Unfulfilled Promise](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Unfulfilled_Promise)** can be equipped on either Bismarck or U-556. In both cases, it provides a negligible stat boost - a very small boost to HP and mild boost to EVA. When equipped on Bismarck, it reduces the effects of the Out of Ammo penalty on the main fleet from 50% to 35% and is not worth the opportunity cost involved in equipping it. When equipped on U-556, it increases her hunting range by 1 level and the amount of time she can stay in combat after surfacing by 4s, the equivalent of 40 oxygen. As it does not increase her oxygen directly, can be equipped alongside a snorkel.
 
 - **[Cat Punch](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Healing_Cat%27s_Paw)** provides a moderate boost to HP and, when equipped by Akashi, increases the output of her healing effects by 20%.

 - **[Catalina/Black Cats](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Consolidated_PBY-5A_Catalina)** provides the same HIT boost as a SG Radar but instead of the EVA boost, provides an ASW boost instead. It also has a similar - albeit slightly less effective - skill that the SG Radar has. Has a unique interaction with the skill found on the Destroyer USS Cooper, allowing her to launch a particularly strong surface damaging airstrike when she drops below 40% HP.
 
 - **[Kolibri Helicopter](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Flettner_Fl_282_Kolibri)** provides a boost in ASW stat, only equippable by Koln post-retrofit in order to activate her ASW-related retrofit skill.

## Auxiliary Selection Guidelines:
As a general rule of thumb, for standard maps, your fleet will always contain at least one SG Radar if you're unable to meet the Recon requirement of a given stage. Additional aux equipment will depend on the class of ships in your fleet and the function of the fleet itself. Boss hunting fleets will typically want to go all-out on offensive auxes, avoiding defensive auxes as much as possible while still maintaining a desirable level of survivability. Mob clearing fleets will generally focus more on defensive auxiliaries to increase their sustained survivability across multiple nodes. If a vanguard ship can complete a clear of a map with an offensive aux equipped, a cheaper ship will generally be able to clear that map with a more defensive setup.

 - The most generic defensive setup for any vanguard unit will be a repair kit and an improved hydraulic rudder (referred to as a wheelbox setup). While not purely optimal on every unit in every situation, it is going to be optimal for most ships in most scenarios and good enough for any vanguard unit that might have a different, more optimal setup. *Note that DDs, with their naturally high EVA stat are generally better off taking 2 HP boosting auxes instead.
 
 - In order to min/max eHP beyond just using a wheelbox setup, you will generally want to shore up a ship's weaknesses, rather than build upon their strengths. Equip HP-boosting aux to ships with low base HP and high base EVA (destroyers); equip EVA boosting auxes to ships with high base HP and low base EVA (mostly Heavy Cruisers). 
 
 - Ships with high luck stats will generally gain more out of every individual point of evasion due to the way luck interacts with the hitrate calculations. Conversely, ships with low luck will often find HP boosts more desirable.
 
 - The hardcap for evasion is 90%. Ships who boost evasion rate directly (not evasion stat boosting) by significant enough degrees run the risk of hitting this cap and will therefore gain more out of HP boosts.
 
 - Due to the generally reduced pressure placed upon the main fleet, these units will typically want to focus more on offensive auxiliary equipment. When main fleet units do equip defensive aux, they will typically equip specialised equipment to deal with a specific threat, such as a fire extinguisher in maps with heavy enemy shelling, or an anti-air radar in maps with heavy aviation presence.
 
 - The most generic offensive setups are double steam catapults for all carriers and both a Type 1 APS and SHS (double shells) for battleships. The SHS may be replaced for a HPFCR, especially for clearing fleets.
 
 - In event maps with limited fleet movement, the SG Radar can be skipped due to the lack of ambushes. Additionally, equipment that increases the speed stat of the ships in your fleet can increase the range of movement available to your fleet. Note that this only applies to stat-based movement speed. While the Beaver Badge's skill effect will increase the movement speed of your fleet in combat, it will not boost movement speed on the map.
 
 - As ramming damage cannot be evaded, a ship's eHP might be higher with an HP-focused loadout in maps whose spawn patterns lead to heavy ramming damage even on a heavy cruiser who might typically gain more eHP for other maps with a non-HP loadout. Additionally, bosses in EX stages cannot miss their attacks. While these stages are generally designed for manual play under the assumption that you will manually dodge enemy shelling patterns, HP-boosting aux will provide a safety net evasion-boosting aux cannot.

 - **[Hedgehog](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Hedgehog)** provides the highest ASW boost amongst all offensive ASW gear, and also the highest possible damage in a single reload cycle. Limited to one copy per account.

 - ~~**[Improved Sonar](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Sonar#Type_3)** provides a small accuracy boost,test the highest ASW stat boost as well as the fastest ping rate of the sonar line. Only one is needed to spot submarines. Only equippable on Destroyers and Light Cruisers (DDs and CLs).~~ *Note: An update to the ASW system in 2021 removed the need for DDs and CLs to equip Sonars in order to detect submarines. DDs and CLs now come with an inherent sonar that scales proportionally with the ships' ASW stat. There is no longer any real reason to use this equipment.

 - **[Depth Charge](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Improved_Depth_Charge#Type_3)**  the only other ASW equip for vanguard ships. Essential to combat submarines effectively when submarines are a large threat (notably in W14). Only equippable on Destroyers and Light Cruisers (DDs and CLs).

 - **[TBM-3 Avenger (ASW)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/General_Motors_TBM-3_Avenger_(ASW)#Type_3)** is available in both the Core Data shop and craftable in the Gear Lab. Readily available ASW plane for Light Carriers (CVLs) and Warspite Kai.

 - **[Swordfish (ASW)](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Fairey_Swordfish_Mk_II-ASV_(ASW)#Type_3)** is also an ASW plane available in the Core Data shop and Gear Lab. While it reloads slightly slower than the TBM-3 Avenger, it also does more damage in a smaller area.
 
### Anti-submarine Auxiliaries Selection Guidelines:
**[Rescue Missions](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Anti-Submarine_Warfare)** are the only currently permanently available way to obtain submarine and ASW equipment. Clearing 3-4 the first time will reward you with some starter ASW equipment (a Blue Basic Sonar and a Blue Basic Depth Charge) which are enough to clear all the way to chapter 10 with enough level advantage. Due to the increasing presence of submarines in event maps as well as the advent of W14's substantial submarine presence, having ASW gear will allow you to prevent damage to your backline from enemy submarines, as well as allowing your backline to remain hidden where relevant (CV/Ls, W14's Detection mechanism).
 
 - Your fleet will want a way to spot submarines (bringing a DD along is preferable, CLs (except Mainz) are capable of revealing submarines as well) and a couple damage dealing equipment (Depth Charges and ASW planes) to do burst damage when the submarines are revealed.

 - Since only Destroyers, Light Cruisers and Light Carriers can equip ASW gear, they are ideal for submarine fights and be sure to gear them properly. Destroyers are especially effective due to their 200+ ASW stat and generally high reload.

 - Since ASW gear take up auxiliary slots usually occupied by survivability auxes, be sure to have enough survivability support (heals/shields) for the ships using them.

 - SOS maps have submarine boss that stay submerged until the 120s mark, which means even if you do not have ASW gears in your fleet, you can still clear it, albeit with an A rank due to the time elapsed.

 - While most submarines can be easily ignored early on, cumulative damage from them across multiple nodes adds up during mob fights in higher worlds SOS maps **on level parity**. Therefore, it is recommended that you have some form of ASW in your mobbing fleets later on as well.
