# Operation Siren Guide test

A new game mode different to the usual stage formats found in the game's story (World) and event stages, Operation Siren (OpSi) is the newest addition to Azur Lane in terms of gameplay content. This is a basic guide for players who've skimmed through the tutorial along with some advise and answers that the playerbase has collectively gained with time since the game mode's implementation.

The Azur Lane EN Wiki has a [dedicated OpSi page](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Operation_Siren) that you should also be reading. It contains information that will be helpful to both new players and those familiar with OpSi mechanics.

## FAQ and Tips:
- **READ THE TUTORIAL**. A lot of questions are answered in the tutorial, remember it, the game won't repeat it. 
- ***PAY ATTENTION WHEN SETTING UP YOUR 1<sup>st</sup> 2 FLEETS***. Use your **strongest** ships AND meowfficers, initial equipment doesn't matter. You can change gear on any ship anytime when they're deployed within OpSi.  The generally ideal fleet for clearing generic nodes in OpSi would use ships with preloads (i.e. Richelieu, Jean Bart, Perseus) with tanky, high gun damage capable CA(s) in the vanguard. This fleet will be with you until you unlock the ability to sortie 4 fleets simultaneously in OpSi, which comes upon completing Chapter 1. This ties into the next point below.
- ***COMPLETE THE OPSI STORY UNTIL YOU UNLOCK 4 FLEETS***. This fleet change is mandatory if you want to exit the port, and where your 1<sup>st</sup> free fleet change comes in. Normally, changing fleets and meowfficers with the Fleet Deployment Order costs a lot of AP - up to 99 AP to use the order immediately after using it once. The cost of this order is reduced down to 0 over time but it takes 24 hours to do so. It is recommended to have 2 specialised fleets - Fleets 2, 3 and 4 should be *specialised* in 1 of 3 damage types (Shelling/Torpedoes/Aviation) to counter Sirens and Promoted Pawns with specific damage debuffs. For example, a fleet filled with 3 BBs, a fleet with 3 CVs and another with 3 Vanguard ships capable of high torpedo damage.
- **"Everything is so confusing, what do?"** - This is permanent content for the most part (META ships are seasonal). Don't worry too much. It will take a lot of consistent playtime to become familiar with the mechanisms and enemies. Just spend your AP where you can - AP has a soft cap of 200 and regenerates at a rate of 1 point per 10 mins.
- **Do the story missions. Seriously, I'm not joking. Do it, a lot of content is gated behind clearing the story missions.** The story markers are the **red exclamation marks** on the map. Story regions reward a lot of adaptive stats, allowing you to fight on and above par even against higher level enemies in OpSi. If you are not end-game or messed up your initial fleet set up, don't stray from the path highlighted by the story markers since high AP entry maps are hard, similar to W12/W13 on Lethal. When you reach the end of Chapter 1 and the game asks you to clear some more regions, do only low star regions if your fleets aren't strong (the higher the Corrosion Level/AP cost, the more difficult the region). Moreover, completing story chapters unlocks Daily Missions and Siren Strongholds.
- **Restart (A.K.A leaving and retrying) battles liberally.** There's no morale or oil cost, meaning that there's no downside to retrying fights. If you missed your preloaded torpedoes on a difficult BB boss and it nearly burns your flagship down, or your vanguard ships start sinking during an Abyssal Zone fight, just restart before your flagship or vanguard sink entirely. Better to live to try again than to sink and have damaged ships you can't make use of.
- **"How do I get out of a region once I've finished clearing it?"** - Click anywhere outside of the map grid to go to the overworld map view. (The back button is a quick way to get to the overworld map view but won't exit your fleets from the current region.)
- **"How do I access a regular region? There's a Stronghold/Abyssal/Hidden Zone on it!"** - Tap on the region, on the bottom left of the descriptive pop-up is a "Change Zone" button. Use that to access whichever zone you want to.
- **"How do I change my fleet compositions and meowfficers?"** - You will need to go to Order (on the radar on the right of the screen) -> Fleet Redeployment to change your fleet and meowfficers. **You may only do so when your fleets are within an Allied (BLUE) Port.**
- **"What to buy with Supply Coins, Supply Tokens and Energy Storage Devices?"** - Refer to the [Shop Guide](#Shop-Guide). But TL;DR: Buying anything that costs coins (the yellow currency) is mostly fine. Buy adaptive tuning samples if you are below 203/203/156. Only buy Gold and Rainbow Plates, Gear Designs and Coordinates with Supply Tokens (purple currency). Coins and Tokens will be exchanged for exchange shop vouchers on the 1<sup>st</sup> of every month. **This monthly reset will also reset your Adaptation stat gains, but star rewards for each region will be kept constant.**
- **"Is {current META ship} permanent?"** - No, she is not. Every META ship is available to obtain for a seasonal time period of about 90 days, after which point she will be replaced by another META ship. The devs have mentioned that every META ship will eventually be made permanently obtainable in some form, but we don't know when or how. 
- **"I'm not getting any EXP in OpSi, what gives?"** - Nodes in story regions and reinforcement (blue) enemy nodes give no EXP except for bosses (sometimes), and fights in OpSi do not cause any Morale or Affection changes as well. After clearing the story regions, the game will force you to enter and clear the region it was based on normally. This has an appropriate AP cost so don't be alarmed when you run out of AP and the game keeps asking you to refill.
- **"What do the icons on bosses here mean, why does the game keep showing me a warning screen?"** - That warning screen just means you are fighting a boss fleet, it's a typical one but do take note of the buffs they get (A -50% shelling damage taken buff for the enemy means you will need torpedoes or planes to do effective damage to the boss, for example). Do be careful if the warning page shows that the enemy has an advantage in the first two adaptive stats - they'll hit MUCH harder while being insanely tanky.
- **"AP Refill with Oil? Should I do that?"** -  The Oil:AP ratio is 10:1. You can refill up to 5 times a **WEEK**. Cost per refill requires 1000/1000/2000/2000/4000 oil in that order. You can also buy AP packs in port/Akashi shops with Supply Coins which effectively removes the need to refill with oil.
- **"What is Meta Lab?"** - It's detailed in the [META Showdown section](#meta-showdown).
- **"Why are Corruption 5 and 6 regions so hard?"** -  Likely because your current adaptive stats are low. Your adaptive stats will be compared to the enemy's -  every point difference is roughly 1% in your or the enemy's favour (Offense and Defense ranges from 70% - 130%, Tactics (healing) is 70% -100%). The recommended end-game stat line is  188/188/144, or 203/203/156 if you're looking to take on Arbiter battles. You will not gain any additional advantage against even the strongest enemies beyond the latter values.
- **"What are star rewards? What are the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> star requirements for this region, why are they all marked as '???' ?"** -  Because they are hidden requirements and sometimes dependent on RNG based events to boot. They'll eventually show when you repeatedly complete the region. The wiki has a section for starring requirements and rewards which you can search by name [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Operation_Siren_Exploration).
- **"What should I do after finishing story?"** - Do at least one Stronghold when your adaptive stat is up to snuff. Refer to the [Stronghold Guide](#Stronghold) below. Simply put, you can go to port mid-Stronghold and your progress will be saved. Do your daily port missions, Strongholds, Abyssal Zones, Hidden Zones and clear all regions in that order.

## General Gameplay:
- There's 3 important things to note: 
   - You swap between fleets either by tapping the fleet you want to move, or by using the "FLEET" button in the bottom left. It lets you choose between your 4 fleets simultaneously.
   - Order Button: found on the radar on the right side of the screen. All Orders (Fleet Deployment, Regroup and Rest, Request Recon, Submarine Support) all cost AP. Change fleet costs up to 99 AP, and slowly drains to 0 over 24 hrs. Regroup and Rest costs a static 50 and has a cooldown of 8 hrs between uses. Request Recon costs up to 10 AP and drains to 0 over 30 mins. Submarine Support costs up to 39 AP and reset to 0 over 1 hr.
   - Scanning Mode: A toggleable viewmode crucial to locate hidden caches and scan loot tiles. More details will be given in the Tile section below.
- **Upon Sinking**: Any sunk ships will be revived with 10% of their HP and given the "Toll of War" debuff (Red wrench icon on the status bar on the left). This disables **ALL** skills for the sunken ship and can only be removed by using the Regroup and Rest or Fleet Deployment Orders in the Order tab or by repairing your ships in an Allied port. ***Healing a ship to full with repair kits will not remove the debuff.***
- **Losing in combat**: Most major boss fights (Abyssal Zones and Strongholds) are multi-staged, meaning the damage you dealt will remain. When a fleet loses in combat (via timing out, flagship sinking or all vanguard ships sinking), it is given the "Low Resolve X" debuff (This debuff has 3 stackable levels) indicated by a cracked triangle - the more broken it is the stronger the debuff effect. Low resolve lowers FP, TRP, ASW, AVI, AA and EVA by 10% for Level I, 30% for Level II and 60% for Level III. Low Resolve can be removed by winning battles - **battles won by other fleets also count** - or by using the Regroup and Rest or Fleet Deployment Orders. These are crucial for Abyssal Zone fights if your fleets are struggling. **Note that "Low Resolve X" debuffs will not be removed by repairing in an Allied port.**
- You can change your fleets and meowfficers by tapping on the Order button (on the Radar to the right) then Fleet Deployment. **You can only use this when inside an Allied port map.**
- Don't be afraid of retreating or restarting, you don't have morale or oil cost to worry about, restart as much as you want to get the outcome that you want. Also **AVOID** allowing your ships to sink in Abyssal Zones - your fleets can still recover from the "Low Resolve III" debuff that's inflicted upon a loss by taking out a generic enemy node inside an Abyssal Zone, but you cannot recover from the "Tolls of War" debuff without using Rest and Regroup lest you want to give up on the boss. Remember, you cannot leave and return to an Abyssal Zone, make your one shot count.

#### Adaptive Tuning Stat:
- Offense, Survivability and Tactics Adaptive Tuning stats all either buff or debuff the enemy depending on the enemy's Adaptative Tuning stats compared your own. Shown on the top left when within a region map OR to the right when in the overworld map under "Operation Info".
- Increase your stats with Tuning Samples (your stat gains are permanent until the monthly reset, so just use them as you get them) or various mini-events that occur on the first clear of any given region.
- As mentioned, the difference between yours and the enemy's stats will make up the respective modifiers: Offense affects the enemy's damage dealt TO YOUR ships, Survivability affects their HP and Tactics affects YOUR fleets' healing efficacy. Offense and Survivability modifiers range from 70-130% for the enemy's offensive power and HP respectively [you want both of these to be a 70% modifier for the enemy], and Tactics (healing efficacy) ranges from 70-100% [you want this one to be at 100% for YOU]. Generally speaking, both the Offense and Survivability stat are more beneficial than the Tactics stat - it's easier to down an enemy that doesn't hit as hard and has less health, rather than relying on in-battle heals you might not have.
- C4 and C5 Abyssal Zone Sirens only have 60 and 90 Adaptive Tuning stats respectively, with C6 Abyssal Zone Sirens having 120 stats. 
- Stronghold Sirens and Promoted Pawns have around 140-144 Adaptive Tuning stats.
- To max out on your Adaptive tuning stat advantage against a given enemy, refer to the equation given [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Operation_Siren#Stat_modifier). The simple advice is to **aim for 188/188/144**, or **203/203/156** if taking on the Arbiter Battle.

## Overworld Map

*The overworld map.*
![](https://i.imgur.com/1USikbu.jpeg)

- **Ports**: Currently 4 ports are important (they are all Allied, blue coloured ports: NY City, Liverpool, Gibraltar and St. Petersburg). They have their own shops that refresh every 3 days. It is recommended to unlock access to all 4 ports ASAP - you can return to the ports anytime once you've ventured to them at least once, even after a monthly reset. 
- **Daily Missions**: Every day, a set of Daily Missions are posted on the Daily Missions tab on the bottom right. Up to 12 missions can be accepted at any one time.
- The overworld map is comprised of regions which cost AP to enter (story regions have red exclamation marks, cost 0 AP to enter and 0 AP to scan if allowed to do so). After clearing a story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally - this comes with the associated AP cost for the region.
- Explanations of on screen markers:
   - Red exclamation marks: Main story markers, follow this until you finish the story. Finishing story (Chapter 4) will unlock Daily Missions and access to Strongholds. More details are in the [Story Guide section](#story-guide).
   - Green clipboards = Puzzle Portals and Daily Quest markers (any side missions that show up in the Information tab will be marked as such).
   - Yellow chests = Hidden Zone (A.K.A. Treasure Map, or Fractured Sea) are from activated Coordinate Loggers in your storage. These are alternate zones that will have you clear some rally points (tiles with red sparks) and rewards you with loot. Using the teleporter or EXIT button will move you back to the region your ships were in before you entered the Hidden Zone, but you cannot return upon exiting.
   - Gold coin icon = Rewards markers for AP chest/repair kits/Supply Coins (shown as rewards for regions you have yet to clear for the first time).
   - Blue Hexagon icon = Respective Adaptive Tuning stat boost, click on it to see details on which stat if you aren't familiar with adaptive stat icon (shown as rewards for regions you have yet to clear for the first time).
   - Red boss icon = One-time entry Abyssal Zones from Siren Coordinate Loggers (not to be confused with regular Coordinate Loggers, these Siren ones are red). If you leave after entering the Abyssal Zone, the region disappears entirely regardless of whether you've defeated the Siren boss within. Drops high quality loot (up to Rainbow rarity materials). Detailed description is in the [Abyssal Zone section](#abyssal-zones).
   - Big Red Swirl = Strongholds (Level 124 - 128 enemies with 144/144/144 stat are found within, a **one-time 200 AP** cost is required to enter, but you can leave and re-enter freely for repairs at an Allied port. Only spawn after finishing story, can drop high quality loot (Rainbow materials).

## Shop Guide:
- There are 3 main currencies: Supply Coins, Special Item Tokens and Energy Storage Devices (ESDs). Tokens and ESDs are used in some mini-events.
- Akashi's Shop (random spawn in region maps) sells the following:
   - Special Item Token packs: cost Supply Coins. Buy these always - Akashi sells them at a discounted rate compared to the port shops that results in a net gain in voucher value.
   - AP boxes: cost Supply Coins. Buy these if you want to grind more. Highly recommended but not mandatory since they do not get converted to vouchers.
   - Repair kits: cost Supply Coins. Don't buy these if you don't need them, mostly not needed since you get more than enough of it from region clear rewards and drops. They also don't get converted to vouchers.
   - Tuning samples: cost ESDs. Increases their respective stat, buy when you need more Adaptive Tuning stat. Remember: it caps at (188/188/144).
- Port shops (refresh every 3 days, all 4 ports draw from the same 150 item pool every reset. **Buy whatever you can afford to** - it'll increase the odds of better items rotating into a shop after the 3 day reset period).
   - Rainbow and Gold plates: cost Tokens. Buy these always. **(Highest Priority)**
   - Gold and Rainbow Design blueprints: cost Tokens. Buy these always. **(Highest Priority)**
   - Regular Coordinate Loggers and Siren Coordinate Loggers: cost Tokens. Regular loggers lead to Hidden Zones while the Siren Coordinate Loggers lead to Abyssal Zones. Buy these always. Rainbow rarity Siren Coordinate Loggers lead to C6 Abyssal Zones which can drop Rainbow rarity loot which are **Highest Priority** should the player are able to clear it (the boss is level 128).
   - Special Item Token packs: cost Supply Coins. Buy these if short of Tokens. You get more than enough if you do your Strongholds consistently.
   - AP boxes: cost Supply Coins. Buy these if you want to grind more.
   - Tuning Samples: cost Tokens/Supply Coins. Buy only when below 188/188/144 Adaptive Tuning stats.
   - The 4 META ship enhancement materials: cost Tokens. Buy if you are swimming in Tokens, helps for enhancing META ships but you'll gain enough if you're consistent about earning Sync Points for a given META ship's season.
   - ESDs: buy if you are really short on them to do random events, and to remove items from the pool to allow better items to rotate in.
   - Gear materials: Skip blue and purple, you'll be swimming in those materials. **Buy gold material boxes, these are medium-high priority since some materials are heavily used in the Gear Lab, e.g. Military-Grade Electronic Components)**.
   
## Regional Map

- Think of these regions in OpSi as normal maps in every chapter in the main story campaign (and AP as the 10 oil cost to enter). A region's difficulty is based on its corrosion level, the AP cost for which scales accordingly. 
	- 80 AP to enter a C6 region with level 114 mobs and 118 boss, 60 AP to enter a C5 region with level 103-104 mobs and level 108 boss. 
	- Abyssal Zones cost 60/80/100 AP for C4, C5 and C6 respectively and spawn a level 102/114/120 Siren boss.
	- Strongholds cost 200 AP and have level 122-124 mobs with level 128 boss.
- Every fleet has their movement restricted in turns of **3 tiles per turn regardless of the fleet's average speed**. This is similar to event maps where you have limited movement tiles per turn - the same concept applies here, but turns actually have an effect on the map. The map is semi-dynamic in that mobs might spawn in over time (for Hidden Zones and when Reinforcement Beacons spawn in some regions on the first clear), meowfficer nodes only advance their salvage process after a turn (up to 10 turns), and some Elite Siren nodes will chase your fleets every 3 turns.
- The Request Recon Order reveals the entire map and allow Auto-Search to work untethered, and Scanning mode will reveal hidden caches and allow you to read cache descriptions to identify ambushes.
- Retreating from a region requires you to click outside of the map grid.
- The hardest currently available regions are Strongholds and Corrosion 6 Abyssal Zones.
- **2** Strongholds spawn on the monthly reset and **1** spawns once a week (on reset going from Sunday to Monday). Up to 3 are displayed at any one time. They have level 128 bosses and level 124 mobs which can be hard if your fleets are poorly equipped and/or underlevelled, or if you lack Adaptive Tuning stats. 
	- **Note: While a maximum of 3 Strongholds can be simultaneously shown on the overworld map, each weekly reset brings one additional Stronghold spawn. If the player has 3 Strongholds still left uncleared, this spawn is "stocked". Once there are less than 3 Strongholds active on the map, logging out and back into the game will cause the stocked Stronghold to spawn.** It's unknown if this is intentional, but independent testing has shown that you can stock as many Stronghold spawns as you want to **within a given month**. On monthly reset, all stocked Strongholds are wiped and 2 Strongholds are spawned as mentioned above.
- Abyssal Zones spawn when you have activated Siren Coordinate Loggers in your Storage. These zones have multi-stage bosses (ranging from level 108 to 120) who will show a weakness to a specific damage type after being engaged once (e.g. taking 30% increased damage from shelling). Every subsequent engagement has a percentage chance of increasing the percentage of the exploitable weakness.
- Reinforcements (coloured blue rather than red) drop no EXO nor loot.

## Map stars
- From the OpSi overworld screen, tap on "Exploration Progress" on the right side of the screen to see the overall progress across all regions. You may also access this menu when within a region by tapping "INFORMATION" -> "Exploration Progress". 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area.
- Each map has 5 stars you can get. Stars 4 and 5 initially have "???" for their requirements - the condition is hidden, it will be revealed once you obtain 3 and 4 total stars respectively, or if you end up completing the requirement inadvertently.
- Star rewards can be claimed from the Exploration Progress menu. Numerous stars require events that only occur on the first clear of a given region after every reset - these are meant to be long-term goals. No harm in taking it slow, star requirements and achievements stay across all resets, these are all **one-time rewards**.
- Some starring requirements are RNG and/or only achievable on the first clear after a reset. Most notable are "Defeat X Promoted Pawns" and "Repel Promoted Pawn fleet ambushes".
	- The "Perform Reconnaissance X times in anomalous zones" requirement refers to hidden tiles near anomalous weather events in a region that give random gains to Adaptive Tuning stats. You can find these tiles by Scanning, and Auto-Search will pick these up if the tile is visible. 
		- No, none of us have any idea why the name of that requirement is so misleading.
- [The wiki table of all starring requirements and their respective rewards can be found here.](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Operation_Siren_Exploration)


- **Bug workaround for "Take control of 1 region" star requirement"**:
   - Requirements: One uncompleted Hidden or Abyssal Zone. (Those are the treasure chests and red boss icons on the map.)
   - Step 1: Enter the safe zone region you already completed, the one whose "complete this map" star is missing. Clear it again. (The second time around, it will be quite easy cause there will be only two enemies and no hazards.) Make sure TB tells you not to forget to pick up your loot.
   - Step 2: Go directly to the Hidden or Abyssal map. Do not pass GO. Do not collect 200 dollars. Most importantly, do not return to port to heal or dillydally first. Go directly there. Then, of course, clear the Hidden or Abyssal Zone.
   - Step 3: When you leave the completed Hidden Zone, leave through the teleporter that you get upon successful clear. Do not push "EXIT" in the lower right. Use the teleporter.
   - Step 4: It will dump you back out in the bugged map you came from, but this time there will be a spoils of war box in the middle of it. Collect it, and it will award you the completion star you never got.
   
## List of random events:

### Random events that happen on map entry:
#### Anomaly weather zone:
RNG Starring condition, there is a hidden loot marker on the map (revealed with scanning mode) coupled with some weather tiles (currents, windstorms, weird towers etc) that reward adaptive stats.

#### Meowfficer Node
A circular yellow-and-white cat paw tile. Upon stepping onto the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowfficers to gather resources. If you choose yes, your meowfficers' skills will be disabled for approx. 10 turns, then they will return with rewards. **Rewards are based on the Command meowfficer's levels and rarity.**

#### Siren Coordinate Logger
Resembles an oil rig with some cranes. Move onto it and you will be ambushed twice and gain access to the device (usable 2-4 times). You can either spend 1 ESD to spawn a mob fleet (that does not reward Adaptive Tuning) or 2 Tokens to spawn an [Energy Cache event](#energy-cache) or just a "Sparkle" loot which doesn't disappear but doesn't drop anything lucrative either.

#### Akashi's Shop:
She spawns upon entry to the map, shopping recommendation is in the [Shop Guide](#shop-guide).

#### General Loot:
Visibly indicated by a blue sparkling tile, hidden loot tiles do exist as well (shown on radar and can be seen through scanning mode).

### Random event that happen after killing a boss node:
#### Siren floating rewards
Spawns 5 sparkling loot tiles, use scanning mode and click on individual tiles to know what will happen. List of events include: Loot, Ambush and Warning Device. You can only collect up to 3 Loot and the other 2 will disappear, Ambush fleet drops no rewards so skip is fine, Warning Device will delete all remaining loot tiles.

#### Siren Jamming 
Purple loot box that spawns after defeating a boss. Scanning will show whether it will jam your fleet or not. Effects are either reducing fleet movement to 1 tile for the next 5 turns or making your fleet move twice in random direction after the next move. 

#### Energy Matrix:
Collect the square Matrix on the map and deliver it to the platform to get rewards.

#### Energy Cache:
Go there, use an ESD and you get some adaptive stat, if it fails, just smash it. Smashing does not reward adaptive tuning.

#### Siren Ambush:
A Siren mob spawns right on top of your fleet, forcing you into combat. Killing it drops some loot.

#### Siren Communication device:
Pink device. Calls in reinforcement every other turn up to a limit. Disabled when stepping on them.

#### Weather Anomaly:
Fog or directional currents spawn around the fleet in a 5x5 square. Look at the radar, go into the fog, destroy the Weather Control Tower marked with a "?" and get some loot.

## Hidden Zone/Fractured Sea/Treasure Map (Yellow Chests on map):
Treasure maps are generated peusdo-randomly with specific patterns. Generally consists of a map divided up into "rooms". Each "room" is a 5x5 square littered with some resource crates. Map size typically corresponds to corrosion number.
- Small map has only one slightly bigger room which has the siren rally point. (Sometimes has Akashi too)
- Medium map has 4 rooms: 2 rally points + 0-1 Weather control device + the rest are random events.
- Big map has 9 rooms: 1 light house + 3 rally points + 0-2 Weather control devices + the rest are random events.

Example of a treasure map room:

![](https://i.imgur.com/AOwiU6k.png)

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points (Red Sparkles) will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which will force you into a fight with a siren defense fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point. Reinforcement fleets (blue siren mob nodes) spawn in infinitely and they don't drop any loot, they do give META ship skill exp however. Clearing all Rally points spawns the Teleporter and some chests (the clearing box usually has high tier loot). In big maps (9 rooms) clearing 2 rally points will spawn a humanoid siren which will chase the closest fleet down but doesn't drop any loot upon defeat.

#### Siren Weather Control Device:
What it says on the tin. Go to it to disable whatever weather anomaly is surrounding the Rally Points (water currents, windstorms, ice floes, fog, etc). Does not have any defensive ambush fleet on it.

#### Siren Data Center
A plus (+) formation of obstacle constructs that spawn with a couple EMP tiles and 2 hidden meowfficer nodes. If scanning mode doesn't reveal the meowfficer nodes right away, moving into the 5x5 room and (maybe) stepping on all of 3 EMP tiles will spawn them.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lWk3HpC.png)

#### Paired switches: 
Putting a fleet on both of the switches automatically will spawn loot and destroy the surrounding rocks.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EEtQWQq.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/COr0s2Y.png)

#### Chest surrounded by rocks:
The rocks will be removed after clearing all Siren Rally points. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/SEGUhsJ.png)

#### Anomaly Chest:
Inconspicuous chest which MIGHT fill the entire 5x5 area with a random weather event when opened (Flaming Sea, Frigid Waters or Whirlpools) if opened before Rally Points are cleared. However, opening the chest after clearing all Rally Points disables the trap entirely. It is therefore recommended to open this chest prior to leaving the Hidden Zone. Anomaly chests can be detected using the radar and scanner as there will not be a yellow "loot" tile underneath the chest compared to regular chests.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jUhDs4v.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/w6krEyF.png)

#### 4 Matrix Cache:
4 Matrix deposits surround a cache, and moving into the 5x5 zone of the caches will spawn 4 matrixes hidden on the map (revealed with scanning mode and radar as a ?). Gathering and using all matrices in will upgrade the cache content.

![](https://i.imgur.com/i4DGdgz.png)

#### Blockade
If a 5x5 room has nothing in it, expect it to be this type of room. Walking into the 5x5 zone will lock your fleet in and either spawn 3 module buffed fleets OR 3 gate devices. Defeating all the module fleets OR choosing the right gate will lift the blockade (the wrong gate will have an ambush fleet). In the gate version, there will also be another gate outside of the 5x5 zone. Moving a fleet to the one spawn outside will destroy the fake gates in the zone. Cannot use scanning mode to bypass the gate holograms.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mdiH5FQ.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/eyJuggC.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/JOCPghx.png)

#### Light house:
ONLY spawns on big maps (9 rooms). Using an ESD here will perform a map recon. If one has already used the recon using the Order -> Recon, ignore this tile.

![](https://i.imgur.com/FIL9rMc.png)

#### Akashi's Shop: same as above
![](https://i.imgur.com/H78OHXq.png)

### Weather Anomalies:

#### Ocean Current:
Moves your fleet to the next tile following the direction of the arrow when stepped on.

#### Directional Wind Vortex:
Will launch your fleet a set number of tiles over all obstacles when stepped on. The number of tiles travelled depends on the side of the vortex (1-4 tiles)

#### EMP tiles:
Causes random movement of your fleet for 1-2 turns when stepped on. Also disables chained movement.

#### Ice pillars and ice floes:
Ice pillars block movement entirely and sometimes can be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower. Ice floes are ice tiles that will continue your fleet momentum until they come into contact with an obstacle or another fleet. Typical ice tile puzzle mechanics.

#### Fog
Movement and vision in fog is restricted to 1 tile. Stronghold Fog allows 2 tiles of visibility. Sometimes there are fog Weather control devices that you can go to and remove the fog in the region.

#### Maelstrom
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned and unable to move for a turn, giving time for potential reinforcements spawns and Siren to move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Flaming Sea:
Stops your movement, does %HP damage to all units in the fleet and persists for a turn. Can NOT kill off your ships so you can swim through it and heal up with repair kits after if needed.

#### Corrosive Sea:
Same as Flaming Sea above, just purple effects.

#### Sheer Cold:
Decreased combat efficiency of the fleet (unclear on how much, best to avoid combat while affected by the debuff). Last up to 5 turns. Also disables chained movement.

#### Red Fog
Denser and redder in color than regular Fog and also blocks movement through it entirely. Can only be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower. (Does not exist outside of story regions).

### Other notable tile type:
#### Colored blockers:
Present in story puzzle maps, using the corresponding colored control tower will turn pebbles into movement blocking constructs and vice versa. 

## Story Guide
The first time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP. It will cost AP after that. They also do not give EXP except the boss fight (needs to be verified).
- Chapter 1: Enemy around level 62-68. After finishing all red markers, it will ask you to clear 6 regions in the NW section, just clear whatever lowest star level to unlock Chapter 2, Fleets 3 and 4, Ashes Showdown as well as the next region via Liverpool port. The game also forces you to do a Fleet Redeployment and have a fleet 3 and 4 else you are soft locked at Liverpool and cannot leave.
- Chapter 2: Enemy around 72-78. Now you need to clear 7-8 region in this Liverpool region to unlock the next region. Unlocks Submarine fleet but doesn't soft lock you to the port.
- Chapter 3: Enemy around 82-88. Unlocks the last region and port Dakar (a red port).
- Chapter 4: Enemy around 92-98. Unlocks daily missions and Strongholds spawn.
- Chapter 5: Enemy around 100-114. Unlocks access to Arbiter Battle (Normal) and (Hard).
- **Notable bug, unclear if it has been fixed or not but is important to mention:** Finishing chapter 1-6 before clearing 6 regions in NW THEN clearing 6 regions might result in a soft lock where the player will not be able to unlock Liverpool port. It is recommended to stray from the red marker for a bit to clear 6 regions (some low level regions are fine, don't have to clear star level 6 regions) before continuing the story.

## Enemies and Special Zones

#### Sirens
Sirens move 5 tiles every 3 turns, plan ahead if you want to avoid them with your fleets. You can also just retreat when they catch up, not much reason to fight them if they are just blue reinforcements that drop no loot.

#### Dangerous enemies (Mixed Recon/Main/Aviation Fleets)
Boss fleets. Have specialized 'modules' that confer enemy buffs/fleet debuff stats/defense making them harder or easier to kill with/without the proper damage type. The list of possible module buffs are [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Operation_Siren#Additional_effects).

#### Stat Table for Stronghold/Abyssal/META boss: [Open this link in a new tab](https://i.imgur.com/9SvzvKo.png).

#### Stronghold:
As detailed above, on each monthly OpSi reset you start with 2 spawned Strongholds, and one is added the next Monday up to a maximum of 3 on the map at one time. 

These maps have a fixed difficulty which will prove troublesome unless you have well-equipped fleets, ~115 levelled ships, and the maximum effective adaptive tuning numbers of **188/188/144** to maximise your damage potential, and even then you can expect some measure of difficulty as enemies range from levels 122-128. . Strongholds drop lots of loot so it is recommended to tackle these maps when you feel ready to do so and you want to get as many OpSi materials as possible.

There are 7 nodes present in a Stronghold. You spawn with 2 'controlled' nodes and 5 'siren' nodes. The 5 siren nodes are walled-off rooms and contain a miniboss inside with 2 entrances to the interior of the node, and there will always be at least 1 'guard' mob blockading these entrances. These nodes will also sometimes feature some kind of weather anomaly that clears up upon miniboss defeat or deactivation through a weather control device inside the node. 

*The 2 friendly-controlled zones.*

*Another siren-controlled zone with fog weather and 2 guard mobs.*
![](https://i.imgur.com/XfKGAa7.png)

There will always be an Invader CL Siren reinforcement that spawns in one of the 2 zones you initially control after you clear 3 siren zones, which will capture the zone it spawns in after 1-5 turns if not defeated. This reinforcement will spawn a chest upon defeat which gives a large amount of Tokens. Note that failing to defeat the Siren before it captures the zone has no effect on the reward.

![](https://i.imgur.com/hmBLj2c.png)

*A captured node.*

![ ](https://i.imgur.com/MwC4c6J.png)

Defeating these 5 bosses unlocks access to the boss Siren of the Stronghold, who will drop loot on defeat and enable you to finish and exit the Stronghold. The final Stronghold Siren bosses are strong, they are not as tanky as Abyssal bosses but they hit very hard even before taking into account their potential module buffs. They are designed to be cleared multiple times to whittle down their health, so don't feel bad if you need to throw your fleets at it more than once or twice. __**Remember that you can always retreat out of Strongholds to return to Port to heal.**__ Strongholds aren't as hard in the sense that Abyssal Zones are, you will clear it eventually even if it takes a bit of time.

*The boss of the Stronghold. Beware the modular de/buffs. Stats can be checked with the link above.* 
![](https://i.imgur.com/5zuZklW.png)

#### Abyssal Zones:
Abyssal zones are maps that feature a large map with a singular humanoid Siren boss that drops loot upon defeat. These maps have difficulties ranging from Corrosion 4 to Corrosion 6 and are spawned by using a Siren Coordinate Logger. **__You cannot come back to this map after you leave even to check overworld, so be careful.__**

*One of the possible Abyssal zone bosses: Enforcer IX - Concealment.*

![](https://i.imgur.com/eAdtrqv.png)

The level of the boss directly corresponds to the R# of the siren coordinate logger. Much like Strongholds, having well-equipped fleets, ships that can reach level parity or outlevel the bosses, and a healthy amount of adaptive tuning numbers will be key to defeating these bosses.

- R4 logger: level 106 boss. Recommended adaptive numbers are 79/79/60.
- R5 logger: level 114 boss. Recommended adaptive numbers are 117/117/90.
- R6 logger: level 128 boss. Recommended adaptive numbers are 176/176/135.

Abyssal bosses reveal their weakness after the first fight. These weaknesses are fixed per enemy and can be reviewed ahead of time using the Stat Table link above. They do not hit as hard but they are twice to thrice as tanky compared to Stronghold bosses. 

*Enforcer IX's shelling weakness revealed.*

![](https://i.imgur.com/0E2Rrqg.png)

Bringing specialised fleets to capitalise on the weaknesses of the enemy is key to beating Abyssal Zone bosses. A sample setup is:

- One 'general'/mobbing fleet to fight the boss first to reveal its weakness.
- One fleet with a triple BB backline.
- One fleet with a triple CV backline.
- One fleet with strong torpedo vanguard ships.

Try to avoid any ships sinking because it will apply the "Damaged" debuff (red wrench on the HP bar) that disables all skills, and can only be removed with the Rest and Regroup order in the Order tab. Losing/timing out on battles applies a "Low Resolve" debuff (red triangle ) that lowers all stats by 10% up to 3 times. This can be removed by using a fleet to win against the mobs hidden in the fog on the sides of the map which clears this debuff from ALL fleets. To find these mobs, look at the 2 sides of the map and there will be ways to get to the lanes in the side and travel through the fog and fight them.

*One of the 2 hidden mob nodes. This map had air currents to access the sides of the map and travel down to these enemies.*

#### Arbiter Battle
Arbiter battles are the hardest content available to be challenged in Operation Siren. Upon completing Chapter 5 of OpSi, 3 practice battles against Enforcers will spawn around the map. After clearing these three fights, the player gains access to the NA Ocean Core Forward Base located in the centre of the map.

 
*The NA Ocean Core Forward Base on the Overview Map.*
![](https://i.imgur.com/Bm1woCK.jpeg)

*NA Ocean Core map. Note the white structure on the left - this is the Forward Base and serves as a port where you can heal your ships. No missions or shop items will be available through this base.*
![](https://i.imgur.com/yHO5RCq.jpeg)

Initially, the Transference Device at the top of the area will feature a yellow portal, rather than the red portal shown in the image above. This indicates that the Arbiter Battle is currently at Normal difficulty. Upon defeating Arbiter Battle at Normal, the ring will turn red and the player will only have access to the Arbiter Battle at Hard difficulty. It does not cost the player any AP to access the Forward Base or the Transference Device. The differences between the two Arbiter Battle difficulties are listed below.

**Normal:** Damage done to Arbiter is permanent. The player may leave the battle region via the EXIT button in the bottom right of the screen to repair your ships at a port or change fleet compositions. On re-entering the battle, Arbiter's HP Pool will remain at the level the player had brought her down to previously. The player has unlimited attempts to bring her HP down to zero.

**Hard:** Damage done to Arbiter is only kept for the one instance that the player begins. This means that the player *must* sink Arbiter within a maximum of 4 battles by using all 4 of the fleets available to them. If the player fails to sink Arbiter with the 4 fleets available to them, they are forced to leave the battle region and Arbiter's HP will be restored to full when they next engage her.

It is worth noting that unlike in Abyssal Zones, there are no Pawn Fleets available to battle to restore morale. Moreover, ***the Regroup and Rest command will NOT be available to use***. Players therefore cannot gain "additional attempts" at taking on Arbiter on Hard difficulty by using either option to restore Morale.

For each given month, the Arbiter the players face will remain constant. The possible buffs the Arbiter can have, therefore, remain constant. Players may use this information to plan their fleet compositions accordingly. It is worth noting that every player across EN, JP and CN servers face off against the same Arbiter with the same buffs. Mutual discussion can therefore prove beneficial to the players in overcoming these battles. 


*Arbiter IX's buffs as shown for the month of December 2021.*

*Arbiter IX pre-fight intel screen. Note that adaptation values of 203/203/156 will be required to maximise the respective boosts against her.*
![](https://i.imgur.com/MAkYd2Q.jpeg)

Arbiter Battles feature a *single* Arbiter type enemy at Level 130, akin to how Abyssal Zones feature a single Siren Boss. Arbiter battles similarly reward the player at set HP thresholds: 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% HP remaining on the Arbiter. Rewards include R3 Gear Lab Materials, T4 Parts, and SR Gear Design Plans. The Arbiter will also drop unique Reward Crates that will be converted to OpSi Vouchers on reset. There is no additional use for these Reward Crates as of December 2021. 



*Arbiter Battle Reward Crates. From left to right, these give 100, 200 and 500 Vouchers each.*

## META Showdown

#### How to get your META ships
META ships are Azur Lane's take on "alter" versions of ships, that are available for ~4 months of the year before they are cycled out for a new META ship, and as of writing there have been 3 META ships introduced (Hiryuu, Ark Royal, and Helena). These ships are distinct from their existing counterparts, have different skills, do not belong to their counterpart's faction, and have similar stats/weapon loadouts. Acquisition and enhancement of these ships is tied to OpSi gameplay. 

META Showdown only unlocks after clearing chapter 1 of the OpSi story. After the initial story fight, you access META fights by collecting coordinate points to unlock a fight with the META ship of the season. You can see a list of META ships made available through META Showdown [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/META_Lab#Synchronization_Rewards).

Doing daily port missions, killing bosses, and collecting chests/loot spawns will reward coordinate points. Daily missions and collecting chests from secured zones are quick ways to accumulate points, but secured zones must be completely cleared in order to ensure they spawn a fresh set of enemies and chests the next time you enter. Accumulate 100 META Coordinate points to unlock your personal META fight, up to twice a day for a total of 200 points daily. 

*The META coordinate counter.*

![](https://i.imgur.com/IzXusDe.png)

You then enter the META Showdown interface via the bottom right button in the overworld view. 

META bosses start from Level 1 and go up to 15 with each full defeat. In the earlier levels (<10-11) you may find yourself oneshotting the boss or doing it in 2 fights. Higher levels will require multiple fights in the style of Abyss/Stronghold boss fights to whittle down the boss to defeat. You may also request support (Friends/Guild/World) to allow other players to assist in defeating the boss, and you can also assist other players in 3 fights per day. If the game pops up an expired coordinate error while you are searching for other players to assist, it means the boss already died.

*A level 15 Helena META boss. 'Boss List' allows you to access other peoples' META fights. 'Data Sync' allows you to access the reward track for your initial META copy and subsequently the point reward track, as well as the unique interface for META ships for limit breaking, upgrading, and skills.*
![](https://i.imgur.com/Gt32eVC.png)

Each fight last 80s, and the boss does quite a bit of damage. 1<sup>st</sup> boss fight costs no oil, 2<sup>nd</sup> costs 40 oil and the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> will cost 20 each. This diminishing pattern continues with each successive fight against the same instance. More information can be found at [this wiki page](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/META_Lab). It does NOT cost AP, morale nor does it give any EXP or affection. Treat META enemies as you would any other enemy: outfit your fleet with the proper gear and go ham. 

Completely defeating a META boss awards Sync Points, which are used to progress through your personal META ship's reward track and gain fortification materials and LB material specific to the current META ship. The host gets 135 + 15 per level Sync points (150 for level 1, 165 for level 2, etc). Supporters gets 27 + 3 per level Sync Points (30 for level 1, 33 for level 2, etc). **Note for level 15: You get 67 points for doing less than 355k, 71 points for doing 355k and 600k-ish and 73 points for doing more than 600k-ish boss damage)**. An exact table of information for Sync Point gains can be found [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/META_Lab#Boss_Levels).

To fully limit break a META ship, earning 25k Sync Points in a season is mandatory. Any more is up to the player's discretion as fortification (enhancement) materials can be bought from port shops.

*Helena META with 28k Sync Points.*

Levelling skills on META ships is different to regular ships. Instead of using skill books the whole way, you unlock a META's skills using 5 T3 (Gold) skill books of their respective type and level them up by doing tasks such as defeat 1 enemy, complete 1 commission, use that META fleet in OpSi, etc. There is a daily cap on the amount of skill exp that can be earned. In addition, you can level 1 skill from multiple different META ships at once. You *cannot*, however, level more than 1 skill per ship at any given time. 

*Helena META's skill page, showing the tasks required to earn EXP.*
![](https://i.imgur.com/pum9GNo.png)

Similarly, fortifying (enhancing) META ships is different to regular ships. The process uses unique fortification materials that can only be obtained from META reward tracks or OpSi blue port shops. There are 4 material types corresponding to the regular stats of FP, TRP, AVI, and RLD. These materials are then consumed by the META ship to enhance her stats.
