# Operation Siren Guide

A massive new game mode has just been introduced, this is a basic beginner guide for people who skimmed through the tutorial along with some quick advices/basic answers from someone who no-lifed this coupled with info from other no-lifers. Please be patient while this gets updated.

## FAQ and TL;DR/Most important advices:
- **READ THE TUTORIAL**. A lot of questions are answered in the tutorial, remember it, the game won't repeat it.
- **__PAY ATTENTION WHEN SETTING UP YOUR 1ST 2 FLEETS__**. Use your **Strongest** ships AND cats, current equipped gears doesn't matter, you can change after and it will apply.  My personal ideal clear comp is one fleet is Richi JB Percy and a torp front line (Naganami Noshiro Jintsuu) and this will solve almost all your mob fights. And the other is triple CVs, tanky high gun damage CA. This will be with you until you unlock 4 fleets which is about an hour of story maps. Which leads me to my next point.
- **__DO STORY UNTIL YOU UNLOCK 4 FLEETS__**: This fleet change is mandatory if you want to exit the port. This is where your 1st free fleet change comes in. Changing fleets and cats cost a lot of AP, up to 100 AP each. The cost get reduced down to 0 over time but it takes roughly 24 hours for it. My personal recommendation is as before, while your fleet 3 and 4 should be mimicking fleet 2 in a sense that it has 2 out of 3 damage type (Shelling/Torp/Plane) to counter the bosses.
- **"Everything is so confusing, what do?"** This is content that is permanent for the most part (the META ships are seasonal). Don't worry too much. But it will take a lot of time and consistent game time to grind. AP has a soft cap of 200, regen 1 point per 10 mins.
- **Do story, seriously I'm not joking, do it, a lot of content is gated behind story**. The story marker are the red exclamation mark on the map. Why I say this is because story regions rewards a lot of adaptive stat allowing you to fight on par and above par against higher level enemies. If you are not end-game or fucked up your fleet set up, don't stray from the path cause high AP entry maps are hard, like W12/W13 lethal level of hard and entering cost AP. When you reached end of chapter 1 and the game ask you to clear some more regions, do only low star regions if your fleets aren't strong (the more AP it cost the higher the star level is). Moreover, story unlocks essential daily/weekly rewards such as missions and strongholds as well as a bigger playing area.
- **Restart a.k.a leaving and retrying battles liberally.** There's no morale or oil cost. There's actually no downsides to retrying fights. If you missed your torp preload on the BB spawn and it burns your flag to hell and back or your frontline ship sunk on Abyss fight, just restart.
- "How do I get out of the map when I finished clearing?" Click outside of the map to go to the overworld view. If you haven't cleared the region, you'll need a fleet at the edge so if you can't exit, move a fleet to the edge. (The back button is a quick way to get to the overworld map view but won't exit your fleets from the current region.
- "How to change fleet comp and cats?" You will need to go to Order (on the radar on the right of the screen) -> Fleet Redeployment to change your fleet and cats. The precise condition is unknown (possibly safe/cleared region) but the button is always available in a port.
- "What to buy with Supply Coin, Item Tokens and Energy Storage Device?" Refer to the [Shop Guide](#Shop-Guide). But TL;DR: Buy everything cost coins is fine. Buy adaptive stat if you are below 200/200/150. Only buy Gold and Rainbow Plates, gear designs and Coordinates with Tokens. Coins and Tokens will be exchanged for exchange shop vouchers every 1st of every month (except Jan 1st). **Every OTHER monthly reset will also reset your adaptive stat and starring rewards.**
- "Is Hiryuu META permanent?" No, she is not. She's this ship season which ends on March 18. 
- "Why do some region drop no EXP, what gives?" Story region and reinforcement fleets gives no exp except for bosses (sometimes), all maps do not give affection as well. After clearing the story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally and cost AP appropriately so don't be alarmed when you run out of AP and the game keeps asking you to refill.
- "What do the bosses here mean, why do they keep warning me?" Warning just means you are hitting a boss fleet, it's a typical one but do take note of the buffs they get (+50% AA and -50% shelling damage taken means you will need torp to do effective damage to the boss for example). They are level appropiate tho so do be careful cause you don't have enough adaptive stat early on to compete with theirs and they hit hard while being insanely tanky.
- "Refills? Should I do that?" The oil:AP ratio is 10:1. You can refill up to 5 times a **WEEK**. It's 1000/1000/2000/2000/4000 oil in that order. You can also buy AP packs in port/Akashi shop with Supply Coins which nixes the need to refill with oil.
- "What is Meta Lab?" It's detailed in the [META Lab/Ashes Showdown section](#Ashes-showdown)
- "Why are 5 or 6 star level regions so hard?" Because your current adaptive stat is low, your adaptive stat will be compared to the enemy, every point difference is 1% in your or the enemy favor roughly (Offense and Defense is 70%-130%, Tactics (healing) is 70-100%). The recommended end-game stat line is 200/200/150.
- "What are 4th and 5th stars in region, why are they all ???" Because they are hidden requirement and sometimes RNG to boot. Shown when you repeatedly do the region. The wiki has a section for starring requirements and rewards which you can search by name [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Operation_Siren_Exploration)
- "What should I do after finishing story?" Do at least one stronghold when your adaptive stat is up to snuff to go below stronghold cap even if you have to strugglebus through it. Refer to the [Stronghold Guide](#Stronghold) below. Simply put, you can go to port mid-stronghold and your progress will be saved. Do your daily port missions, strongholds, Abyss, treasure maps and clear all regions in that order.

## General Gameplay:
- There's 3 important things 1st: 
   - Fleet swapping is bottom left now cause you will eventually get access to up to 4 fleet simultanously. 
   - Order tab: on the radar on the right side of the screen. Change fleet, resting to heal up and remove fatigue, recon, submarine call-ins all cost AP. Change fleet cost up to 99 AP, slowly drain to 0 over 24 hrs. Rest cost a static 50 and has a cooldown of 24 hrs as well. Recon cost up to 9 AP drain to 0 over 10-15 mins. Submarine support cost up to 39 AP and reset to 0 over 30 mins.
   - Scanning mode: clunky toggle but crucial to locate hidden cache and scan loot tiles. More details will be given in the Tile section below.
- Sinking: any sunk ships will be revived with 10% of their hp and given the "damaged" debuff (red wrench icon on the hp bar). This disables **ALL** skills and can only be removed by using the Regroup and Rest and Fleet Redeployment in the "Navigational Order" tab or repairing your ships at a port. __Healing a ship to full with repairkits will not remove the debuff.__
- Losing in combat: Most major boss fights (Abyss and Stronghold) are multi-staged, meaning the damage you dealt will remains. When a fleet lose in combat (via timing out or flag ship sinking or all vanguard dies), it is given the "Low Resolve X" debuff (can stack up to 3 times) indicated by a triangle (the more broken it is the stronger the debuff effect. Low resolve lowers FP, TRP, ASW, AVI, AA and EVA by 10% per stack. Low Resolve can be removed by winning battles (if done by other fleet it still counts) or using the Regroup and Rest and Fleet Deploy Navigational Orders. (Crucial for Abyss fights if your fleet is struggling)
- Change fleet and cats by going to Order (on the Radar to the right) then Fleet Redeployment.
- Don't be afraid of retreating or restarting, you don't have morale or oil cost to worry about, restart as much as you want to get the outcome that you want. Also **AVOID** ship sinking in Abyssal Zone cause you cannot recover from the "Damaged" debuff without using Rest and Regroup lest you want to give up on the boss.

#### Adaptability Stat:
- Offense, Survivability, Tactic Adaptability all either buff or debuff the enemy depends on the enemy's count and your own. Shown on the top right in region maps above your cats and fleet buffs OR to the right of the overworld map.
- Increase it with Tuning Samples (they are perma until every other cycle reset so just use them as you get them) or Adaptability modules (Hexagon on maps) collected in the map.
- The difference will make up the modifier with Offense affect the enemy's damage dealt, Survivability affect their hp and Tactics affect YOUR fleet healing capability. With Offense and Survivability ranging from 70%-130% and Tactics (healing) is 70-100% so you can have your Tactics stat below the other 2 by a margin of 30-50 points. 
- C4 and C5 abyssal zones only have 60 and then 90 adaptive stat, with C6 Abyss level 120 boss with 120 stat. 
- Stronghold have around 140-144 adaptive stats.
- To max out on your adaptive stat advantage you need ~195 of Offense and Survival with Tactic at 140-150 but the simpler advice is **aim 200/200/150**.

## Overworld Map

- Ports: currently 4 ports are important (they are all blue colored: NYC, Liverpool, Gibraltar, St. Pete), they have their own shop that refresh every 3 days and have daily missions **after you finished story**. It is recommended to unlock all of them after you finish story ASAP. 
- Comprises of regions which cost AP to enter (story regions has red exclamation mark on it cost 0 AP to enter and 0 AP to scan if they allow you). After clearing the story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally and cost AP appropriately.
- Explanations of on screen markers:
   - Red exclamation marks: Main story markers, follow this until you finish the story. Finishing story (4-6) will unlock daily missions and weekly strongholds. More details are in the [Story Guide section](#story-guide)
   - Green clipboards = Puzzle Portals and Daily Quest markers (any side missions that show up in the Information tab will be marked as such)
   - Yellow chests = Fracture Sea/Obscured Zone/Treasure Map from blue coordinates in storage (alternate zone that will have you clear some rally points for loot, using the teleporter will move you back to the region b4 you enter)
   - Gold coin icon = just rewards markers for AP chest/healing boxes/coins (mostly shown as rewards for regions you haven't controlled)
   - Blue Hexagon icon = respective Adaptive stat boost, click on it to see details on which stat if you aren't familiar with adaptive stat icon(shown as rewards for regions you haven't controlled)
   - Red boss icon = One time entry Abyssal Zones from Red coordinates (depending on Corrosion level boss with a massive hp pool and requires multiple fleets to tackle). If you leave after unlocking the gate to spawn the boss, the boss will disappear. Can drops high quality loot (up to rainbow mats) from Corrosion level 4 and above. They don't hit as hard as Stronghold bosses however. There's 2 mob fleet on the bottom right of the screen shrouded in fog, to get there and get a win to cleaar your t
   - Swirling Abyss = Strongholds (level 128 enemies with 144/144/144 stat) cost 100 AP ONCE to enter and can be retreated freely for repairs. Only spawn after finishing story. Can drops high quality loot (rainbow mats).

## Shop Guide:
- There are 3 main currency: Supply Coins, Item Tokens and Energy Storage Device (ESDs). Tokens and ESDs are used in some events.
- Akashi shop (random event in region maps) sells the following:
   - Tokens packs: for coins. Buy these always.
   - AP boxes: for coins. Buy these always
   - Healing kits: for coins. Buy these if you are short on it, mostly not needed.
   - Tuning samples: increases their respective stat for ESDs. Only buy when below the Adaptive stat break point above (200/200/150)
- Port shops (refresh every half week-ish or twice a week):
   - Plates: Rainbow and Gold plates for Tokens. Buy these always
   - Gold Design blueprints for Tokens. Buy these always
   - Blue and Red Coordinates for Tokens. Blue leads to Obscured Zone/Treasure Maps. Red leads to Abyssal Zone. Buy these always
   - Tokens packs: for coins. Buy these always.
   - AP boxes: for coins. Buy these always
   - Tuning samples: for Tokens/Coins. Same as above (only when below 200/200/150)
   - The 4 META ship enhancement materials: Ignore is fine. Only buy if you are swimming in Tokens/Coins.
   - ESDs for tokens: buy if you are really short on them
   - Gear materials: Skip, buy gold boxes 1st if any.
   
## Regional Map

- Think of it as normal maps in every chapter in main campaign (and AP as the 10 oil cost to enter). Region's difficulty is based on star/corrosion level which scale up the AP cost (80 AP region has level 114 mobs and 118 boss, 60 AP has level 103-104, 108 boss. Abyss cost up to 60/80/100 AP and spawn 102/114/120 boss, Stronghold cost 200 AP fixed and have 122 mobs to 128 boss)
- Every fleet has their movement restricted in turns (much like event maps where you have limited movement tiles). Same concept here but turns actually have an effect on the map. The map is semi-dynamic in that mobs might spawn in over time (like in Obscured Zone), cat salvages overtime (10 turns), discovering elite fleets (enhanced enemies with modules and more drops as well as spawn a random event when defeated) when you meet them on the map.
- Recon reveal the entire map so scanning mode will reveal hidden cache/read cache descriptions easier.
- Retreating from a region requires a fleet at the edge of the map if you haven't cleared it. If you have, just click outside.
- The hardest currently available regions are: Strongholds and High Corrosion 6 Abyss Coordinates.
- Strongholds reset once a week (likely monday) to a cap of 3, they have level 128 bosses and mobs which can be hard if under adaptive stats.
- Abyssal zones spawn when using Coordinates Loggers in Storage. Can have multi-stage bosses (ranging from 108 to 120) who will show a weakness after a certain hp threshold.
- Reinforcements (colored blue rather than red) drops no exp or loot.

## Map stars
- Each map has 5 stars you can get. Star 4 and 5 are for now "???" meaning the condition is hidden, you will see what it is when you get stars 3 and 4 respectively.
- Press information -> exploration progress to show the  objectives for the current area. 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area.
- Star rewards can be claimed at ports. (there are 75 regions so dw about rushing this content)
- Some starring requirement are RNG. Most notable are Promoted Pawns spawn, Logger random event and Anomaly Weather node.
- [Here's the wiki table of all starring requirements and their respective rewards](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Operation_Siren_Exploration)
- Starring conditions always relates to random events generated on entry and not on Promoted Pawns/boss kills.

### Random event that happen on entry:
#### Anomaly weather zone:
RNG Starring condition, there's a hidden loot marker in its vicinity (revealed with scanning mode) coupled with some weather tiles (currents, windstorms, weird towers etc) that rewards adaptive stats.

#### Meowficers Node
Upon entering the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowficers to gather resources. If you choose to, your meowficcer skills will be disabled for 10 turns, then they will return with rewards. **Rewards are based on the Command Meowficcer levels and rarity.**

#### Siren Coordinate Logger
Looks like a oil rig with some cranes, moving on it and you will be ambushed twice and gain access to the device (usable 2-4 times). You can either spend 1 ESD to spawn a mob fleet (that doesn't drop modules) or 2 Tokens to spawn an [Energy Cache event](#energy-cache) or just a "Sparkle" loot which doesn't disappear but doesn't drop anything lucrative either.

#### Akashi's Shop:
She spawns upon entry to the map, shopping recommendation is in the [Shop Guide](#shop-guide)

#### General Loot:
Indicated by a "sparkle", a chest or a hidden (shown on radar and can be seen through scanning mode)

### Random event that happen after killing a boss node:
#### Siren floating rewards
Spawn 5 "sparkle" tiles, use scanning mode and click on individual tiles to know what will happen. List of events include: Loot, Ambush and Warning Device. You can only collect up to 3 Loot and the other 2 will disappear, Ambush fleet drops no rewards so skip is fine, Warning Device will deletes all remaining tiles.

#### Siren Jamming 
Box that spawn after defeating a boss. Scanning will show whether it will jam your fleet or not. Either reducing that fleet movement to 1 tile for the next 5 turns or make your fleet move twice in random direction after the next move. 

#### Energy Matrix:
Collect the Matrix on the map and deliver it to the platform to get rewards.

#### Energy Cache:
Go there, use the Energy Storage Device and you get some adaptive stat, if it fails, just smash it. Smashing seems to never give adaptive stat.

#### Siren Ambush:
Straight forward a Siren mob spawn right on top of your fleet. Killing it drop some loot.

#### Siren Rally Point:
Calls in reinforcement every 3 turns. Disabled when stepping on them.

#### Weather Anomaly:
Usually fogs or some directional currents spawn around the fleet in a 5x5 square. Look at the radar, go into the fog, destroy the Weather Control Tower marked with a "?" and get some loot.

### Random event that happens in Obscured Zone/Fractured Sea/Treasure Map (they are all names to the Yellow Icon on the map):

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which will force you into a fight with a siren defense fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point. Reinforcement fleets (blue in color) spawn in infinitely and they don't drop any loot, avoid them if possible. Clearing all Rally points spawn a Teleporter and some chests. In big maps (9x9) clearing 2 rally points will spawn a siren fleet which will chase your fleet down but doesn't drop any loot.

#### Siren Weather Control Device:
Does what it said on the tin, go to it to disable whatever weather anomaly surrounding the Rally Points. Doesn't have any ambush fleet on it apparently.

#### Siren Data Center(?)
A plus formation of obstacle constructs that spawn with a couple EMP tiles and possibly 2 hidden Meowfficer nodes. If scanning mode doesn't reveal the meowfficer nodes, stepping on all of 3 EMP tiles will spawn them.

#### Paired switches: 
Putting a fleet on both of the switches automatically will spawn loot and destroy all the surrounding rocks.

#### Chest surrounded by rocks:
Rocks will be removed after clearing all Siren Rally points. 

#### Anomaly Chest:
Inconspicuous chest which fill the entire 5x5 area with a random weather event (Flaming Sea, Frigid Waters, etc) which will also hide any other event (e.g 4 Matrix event tile). So it is recommended to do this zone last.

#### 4 Matrix Box:
4 Matrix deposits surround a cache, move into the 5x5 zone of it will spawn the 4 matrixes hidden on the map (revealed with scanning mode). Putting matrix in will upgrade the cache content. The cache can only be opened after returning at least 2 matrixes.

#### Blockade
If the 5x5 Square has nothing in it, expect it to be this event. Walking into the zone will lock your fleet in and either spawn 3 module buffed fleets OR 3 gate typed devices. Defeating all the module fleets OR choosing the right gate will lift the blockade (note the wrong gate will have an ambush fleet). In the gate version, there will also be another gate outside of the 5x5 zone. Moving a fleet to the one spawn outside will destroy the fake gates in the zone. Cannot use scanning mode to bypass the gate holograms.

#### Light house:
Light house zone seems to always spawn on the Bottom square, 6 o'clock position ONLY on big maps (9 5x5 square shaped zone with its own event, 3 of which are Siren Rally points and 2 of them are protected by a Siren Weather Control device). Using a ESD here will perform a free recon. If one has already used the recon using AP, ignore this event.

#### Akashi's Shop: same as above

### Weather Anomalies:

#### EMP tiles:
Cause random movement of your fleet for 1-2 turns when stepped on.

#### Ice pillars and ice floes:
Ice pillars block movement entirely and sometimes can be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower. Ice floes are ice tiles that will continue your fleet momentum till they come in contact with an obstacle or another fleet.

#### Fog
Movement in fog is restricted to 1 tile. Sometimes there's a Fog control tower that you can go to and remove all fog on the map.

#### Whirlpool
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned, eating your moevement, meaning that reinforcements can spawn and move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Directional Wind Storms:
Will launch your fleet a set number of tiles over all obstacles when stepped on.

#### Ocean Currents:
Direct your fleet to the tile it points to.

#### Flaming Sea:
Do a %hp damage to all unit in the fleet and persist a turn.

#### Corrosive Sea:
Does %hp damage to all unit in the fleet.

#### Frigid Sea:
Decrease combat efficiency of the fleet (unclear on how much, best to avoid combat while affected by the debuff). Last up to 5 turns.

### Other notable tile type:
#### Maelstrom
Hazier and redder in color than Fog and also seems to block movement through it entirely, can only be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower.

#### Colored blockers:
Present in Puzzle maps, using the corresponding colored control tower will turn pebbles into movement blocking contructs and vice versa. 

## Enemies and Special Zones explanation:

#### Sirens
Sirens move 5 tiles every 3 turns, plan ahead if you want to avoid them with your fleets. You can also just retreat when they caught up, not much reason to fight them if they are just blue reinforcement that drop no loot.

#### Dangerous enemies (Mixed Recon/Main/Aviation Fleets)
Basically boss fleets. Have specialized modules that buff/debuff stats/defense making them harder or easier to kill with/without the proper damage type. The list of possible module buffs are [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Operation_Siren#Additional_effects)

#### Stronghold:
There are 7 zones. You spawn with 2 controled zones and siren has 5 zones. There will always be an Invader Siren reinforcement that spawn after you clear 3 zones which will steal one of your zone after 3 turns. The final Stronghold Siren boss are strong, they are not as tanky but they hit very hard even before taking account of their module buffs. They are supposedly multi-staged boss but you can do it with just 2 fleets. You can always retreat out of strongholds to return to Port to heal. So stronghold isn't as hard, just takes a bit of time to clear.

#### Abyssal Zones:
Currently only have 4 types of bosses: DD, CL, CA and BB. Abyssal bosses reveal their weakness after certain hp thresholds. They all have below average AA stat making them susceptible to CV damage. They also have an uncanny weakness to Airstrikes a lot of the time. They hit not as hard but they are twice as tanky compared to Stronghold bosses. The key to beating these Abyss bosses are to bring a well-equipped CV fleet. Also try to avoid any ship sinking because it will apply an debuff (red wrench on the hp bar) that disable skills to the ship that sunk which can only be removed with the Rest and Regroup in the Order Tab. Failing battle apply a "Low Resolve" debuff (triangle on the fleet on the map) that debuff all stats by 10% up to 3 times which can be removed by winning against the mobs hidden in the fog. To get to them look at the 2 side of the map, there will be ways to get to the lanes in the side and travel to the fog and fight them. Other fleets also removed their "Low Resolve" if any fleet wins a battle.

## Story Guide
First time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP, it will cost AP after that. They also do not give EXP except the boss fight iirc.
- Chapter 1: Enemy around level 62-68. After finishing all red markers, it will ask you to clear 6 regions in the NW section, just clear whatever lowest star level to unlock Chapter 2, Fleet 3 and 4, Ashes Showdown as well as the next region via Liverpool port. The game also forces you to do a Fleet Redeployment and have a fleet 3 and 4 else you are soft locked at Liverpool and can't leave.
- Chapter 2: Enemy around 72-78. Same concept, now you need to clear 7-8 region in this Liverpool region to unlock the next region. Unlocks Submarine fleet but doesn't soft lock you to the port.
- Chapter 3: Enemy around 82-88. Same concept, unlocks the last region and port Dakar (a red port).
- Chapter 4: Enemy around 92-98. Same concept but unlocks daily missions and Strongholds spawn.

## Ashes Showdown

#### TL;DR:
- Only unlocks after clearing chapter 1 of the OpSi story
- Do maps, kill bosses, collect chests/loot spawns and you will get some coordinate points.
- Get 100 coordinate points and you can host/summon your META boss up to twice a day.
- Host don't need to do anything but send out invites, supporters will kill it for you. Host gets 135 + 15 per level Analysis points (150 for level 1, 165 or level 2, etc). Supporters gets 27 + 3 per level Analysis Points (30 for level 1, 33 for level 2, etc). **Except for level 15 which you gets 71 points**. You get 2 host per day and 3 support per day. Host counter is above your Analysis point count, if it's greyed out, you will stop accumulating coordinate points (you will start at 0 the next day). Support counter is on the top right of the Ashes Showdown interface.
- The fight last 60s, the boss kinda does damage and it cost no oil, AP, morale to do and gives no exp or affection either.
- The strat is: if you host then go in, change your fleet to your best boss slayer fleet (the fight last 60s), save your fleet, get out and invite people, ignore it and do your 3 support attempts while waiting. To use your support entries: sit in chat room, wait till someone post an invite and click to join in OR choose one on boss list and click attack till you get a fight (If the game pops up an expired, it means the boss already dies). Have fun~~~

#### Patch Note that explains this in a long-winded way:
You can obtain Analysis Points by defeating the META boss in Ashes Showdown.
Achieve Analysis Point milestones to obtain META ships and other rewards.

Ashes Showdown involves the following 2 elements,
1) Ashes Coordinate Analysis (unlocking the boss fight)
2) Fighting the META boss

※ Ashes Showdown is unlocked after clearing chapter 1 of the Operation Siren story campaign.

★ Ashes Coordinate Analysis
You can obtain Ashes Coordinates from a number of ways including defeating enemies.
The number of Ashes Coordinates is displayed on the upper right corner of the sea region map.

Once you have obtained the max number of Ashes Coordinates, you can unlock the META boss fight by performing Coordinate Analysis using all of your Coordinates.
You can only perform Coordinate Analysis twice per day.
After daily reset, you will be able to perform Coordinate Analysis again, but the number of your Ashes Coordinates will be reset back to the starting number.

★ Fighting the META boss
You can access the fight from the button on the lower right corner of the sea region map.
The META boss fight involves,
1) The fight that you yourself unlock
2) Any requests for backup that you accept from other commanders.

Fleets sortied for Operation Siren can be used for the boss fight. Meowfficers and submarines cannot be used.
Once you complete a META boss fight that you unlocked yourself, the next META boss will be harder (a level increase).
Requesting for backup allows other commanders to access your META boss fight.

Defeating the boss rewards Analysis Points. If it was a coop fight, all commanders who participated will receive Analysis Points.

※ A META boss fight will be open for 24 hours.
※ You may spend Fuel and attempt the META boss fight which you unlocked yourself as many times as you would like until the boss is defeated.
※ There is a limit on how many backup requests you can accept per day.
※ A maximum of 30 commanders can participate in 1 Ashes Showdown. The boss fight will become unable to join once full.
※ Ashes Showdown does not give any ship EXP nor does it affect ship morale and affection.
