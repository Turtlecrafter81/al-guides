# Operation Siren Guide

A massive new game mode has just been introduced, this is a basic beginner guide for people who skimmed through the tutorial along with some quick advices/basic answers from someone who no-lifed this for 6 hours. This is very new so everything is new and unknown, please be patient while this gets updated.

## FAQ and TL;DR/Most important advices:
- **READ THE TUTORIAL**. A lot of questions are answered in the tutorial, remember it, the game won't repeat it.
- (Optional) **Read the patch note**. This is a link to the ALEC (Azur Lane English Community/Azur Knights) JP patch note: https://discord.com/channels/321283108122918924/362997422018002944/790860232594817034
- **__PAY ATTENTION WHEN SETTING UP YOUR 1ST 2 FLEETS__**. Use your **Strongest** ships AND cats, current equipped gears doesn't matter, you can change after and it will apply.  My personal ideal clear comp is one fleet is Richi JB Percy and a torp front line (Naganami Noshiro Jintsuu) and this will solve almost all your mob fights. And the other is triple CVs, tanky high gun damage CA. This will be with you until you unlock 4 fleets which is about an hour of story maps. Which leads me to my next point.
- **__DO STORY UNTIL YOU UNLOCK 4 FLEETS__**: This fleet change is almost mandatory if you want to keep progressing story afterwards. This is where your 1st free fleet change comes in. Changing fleets and cats cost a lot of AP. 100 AP each. The cost get reduced down to 0 over time but it takes roughly 24? hours for it. My personal recommendation is as before, while your fleet 3 and 4 should be mimicking fleet 2 in a sense that it has 2 out of 3 damage type (Shelling/Torp/Plane) to counter the bosses.
- **"Everything is so confusing, what do?"** This is content that is permanent for the most part (the META ships are seasonal). Don't worry too much. But it will take a lot of time and consistent game time to grind. AP has a soft cap of 100, regen 1 point per 10 mins.
- **Do story, seriously I'm not joking, do it, it helps a lot**. The story marker are the red and green exclamation mark on the map. If you are not end-game or fucked up your fleet set up, don't stray from the path cause high AP entry maps are hard, like W12/W13 level of hard and entering cost AP. Especially so since you do not have enough modules to compete with the enemy so you get extra debuffed. (+/-30% on every facets, offense, defense, healing).
- **Restart a.k.a leaving and retrying battles liberally.** There's no morale or oil cost. There's actually no downsides to retrying fights. If you missed your torp preload on the Nevada and it burns your flag to hell and back, just restart.
- "How do I get out of the map when I finished clearing?" Click outside of the map to go to the overworld view. If you haven't cleared the region, you'll need a fleet at the edge so if you can't exit, move a fleet to the edge. (The back button is a quick way to get to the overworld map view but won't exit your fleets from the current region unless it's a port)
- "How to change fleet and cats?" You will need to go to Order -> Fleet Redeployment to change your fleet and cats. The precise condition is unknown (possibly safe/cleared region) but the button is always available in a port.
- "What to buy with Supply Coin and Item Tokens?" Don't know yet, they will be exchanged for some kind of voucher ticket every season anyways so use them liberally.
- "Wait, what season?" The META ship season. This season ends on March 18. All currency will be converted then.
- "Why do some region drop no EXP, what gives?" Story region gives no exp whatsoever, all maps do not give affection as well. After clearing the story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally and cost AP appropriately so don't be alarmed when you run out of AP and the game keeps asking you to refill.
- "What do the bosses here mean, why are they keep warning me?" Warning just means you are hitting a boss fleet, it's a typical one but do take note of the buffs they get (+50% AA and -50% shelling damage taken means you will need torp to do effective damage to the boss for example). They are level appropiate tho so do be careful cause you don't have enough modules early on to compete with theirs and you will get massively debuffed.
- "Refills? Should I do that?" The oil:AP ratio is 10:1. You can refill up to 5 times a **WEEK**, the game has typo, go figure. It's 1000/1000/2000/2000/4000 oil in that order. You can also buy AP packs in port shop with Supply Coins.
- "What is Meta Lab?" It's detailed in the [META Lab section](Operation%20Siren%20Guide.md#ashes-coordinate-and-hiryuu-meta)
- "Why are 5 or 6 star level regions so hard?" Because your current module count is low, your module count will be compared to the enemy, every point difference is 1% in your or the enemy favor (Offense and Defense is 70%-130%, Tactics (healing) is 70-100%)
- "What are 4th and 5th stars in region, why are they all ???" Because they are hidden requirement and sometimes RNG to boot. [Here's a datamined spreadsheet of all starring requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XvXwQ1MUvIbRe44G0eAfo9rnMGm6BflHbjGcbwIcNrE/edit?usp=sharing)

## General Gameplay and Maps:

#### General Gameplay:
- There's 3 important things 1st: 
   - Fleet swapping is bottom left now cause you will eventually get access to up to 4 fleet simultanously. 
   - Order tab: on the radar on the right side of the screen. Change fleet, resting to heal up and remove fatigue, recon, submarine call-ins all cost AP. Change fleet cost up to 100 AP, slowly drain to 0 over time. Rest cost a static 50. recon cost up to 12? drain to 0 over 15-30 mins.
   - Scanning mode: clunky piece of shit but important to locate hidden cache. If you do not have the entire map reveal through recon, you gonna need to go here often to locate hidden cache that will not show up on the map.
- Change fleet and cats by going to Order (on the Radar to the right) then Fleet Redeployment.
- Don't be afraid of retreating or restarting, you don't have morale or oil cost to worry about, restart as much as you want to get the outcome that you want.

#### Overworld map:

- Ports: currently USS, HMS ports are known, they have their own shop that refresh every 3 days approx. There's 2 kind of currency: Operation Supply Coins and Special Item Tokens. We currently don't know much but using the supply coins liberally is fine, they are pretty abundant.
- Regions that cost AP to enter (story regions (has red/green exclamation mark on it cost 0 AP to enter and 0 AP to scan if they allow you). After clearing the story region, the game will force you to enter and clear the region normally and cost AP appropriately.

### Regional maps and effects/point of interest:

- Think of it as normal maps in every chapter in main campaign (and AP as the 10 oil cost to enter). Harder region cost more AP (80 AP region has level 114 mobs and 118 boss, 60 AP has level 103-104, 108 boss)
- Every fleet has their movement restricted in turns (much like event maps where you have limited movement tiles). Same concept here but turns actually have an effect on the map. The map is semi-dynamic in that mobs might spawn in over time, cat salvages overtime, discovering elite fleets (enhanced enemies with modules and more drops) when you meet them on the map
- Recon reveal the entire map so scanning mode will reveal hidden cache easier.
- Retreating from a region requires a fleet at the edge of the map if you haven't cleared it. If you have, just click outside.

#### Modules
Offense, Defense, Healing modules all either buff or debuff your fleet in battle depends on the enemy module and your own. You can increase it with items (they are perma so just use it as you get them) or modules collected in the map. The difference will make up the modifier. Offense and Defense is 70%-130%, Tactics (healing) is 70-100%.

#### Main OpSiren Story
First time you enter an area for the story it costs no AP, it will cost AP after that. They also do not give EXP except the boss fight iirc.

#### Map stars
- Each map has 5 stars you can get. Star 4 and 5 are for now "???" meaning locked and can't be obtained so just ignore it.
Press information -> exploration progress to show the  objectives for the current area. 3 objectives are revealed on the first time you enter an area. [Intel] can spawn [randomly(?)] revealing an additional star requirement.
- Star rewards can be claimed at ports. (there are 75 regions so dw about rushing this content)
- Some starring requirement are RNG
- [Here's a datamined spreadsheet of all starring requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XvXwQ1MUvIbRe44G0eAfo9rnMGm6BflHbjGcbwIcNrE/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Siren floating rewards
Seems to spawn 5 interest points, you can only collect up to 3, 2 will always sink regardless of turns taken.

#### Siren Jamming 
Occasionally on collecting an item you will be jammed, reducing that fleet movement to 1 tile for the next 5 moves.

#### Meowficers Node
Upon entering the tile you will be asked whether or not you want to deploy Meowficers to gather resources. If you choose to, your meowficcer skills will be disabled for an amount (about 7-10) of turns, then they will return with rewards. Rewards are based on Meowficcer levels and rarity.

#### Whirlpool
Entering or moving into a whirlpool will stop you there, and each time you try to move out you might be stunned eating your moevement, meaning that reinforcements can spawn and move closer. Movement out of the Whirlpool is restricted to 1 tile.

#### Siren Rally Points
Siren rally points will keep spawning reinforcement fleets until all of them are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving onto them, which might force you into a fight with a siren defense fleet. Defeating the fleet will remove the rally point.

#### Fog
Movement in fog is restricted to 1 tile. Normally there will be a Fog generator that you can go to and remove all fog on the map.

#### Energy matrix:
Collect the Matrix on the map and deliver it to the platform to get rewards.

#### Energy Cache: (Place where you use the Energy storage device)
Go there, use the Energy Storage device and you get loot, if it fails, just smash it. If you don't want to spend the Storage for w.e reason, smashing is fine. No known difference between the 2 options.

#### Siren Coordinate Logger
Looks like a oil rig, moving on it and you will be ambushed twice and gain access to the device (up to 3-4 times). You can either spend one Energy Storage to spawn a mob fleet (that might drop modules) or 2 item tokens to spawn an Energy Cache event (that rewards modules and some other loot) or just a "Sparkle" loot which doesn't disappear but doesn't drop anything lucrative either.

#### Ice tiles
Ice tiles block movement entirely and can only be removed by destroying the corresponding Siren Control Tower

#### Maelstrom
Hazier than Fog and also seems to block movement through it entirely, can only be removed by destroying the corresponding Sire Control Tower

## Enemies

#### Sirens
Sirens move whenever you move three times, and unlike events they move 5 tiles at once instead of 2, so plan ahead if you want to avoid them with your fleets. You can also just retreat when they caught up, not much reason to fight them if they are just reinforcement that drop no loot.

#### Dangerous enemies (Mixed Recon Fleets)
Basically boss fleets. Have specialized modules that buff/debuff stats/defense making them harder or easier to kill with/without the proper damage type. I did notice that "bosses that have a zombie type module that heals after a certain hp% threshold" tend to be accompanied by a +% damage taken which makes theem easy to burst down.

#### Stronghold Bosses
Big bad highly leveled Siren boss that has powerful accompanying modules that can seriously wreck fleets. They are also multi-staged boss fight so having multiple leveled fleet is nearly mandatory to beating them.

## Ashes Coordinate and Hiryuu META

#### TL;DR:
- Only unlocks after clearing chapter 1 of the OpSi story
- Do maps, kill bosses, collect chests/loot spawns and you will get some coordinate points.
- Get 100 coordinate points and you can host/summon your META boss up to twice a day (they are really easy until like level 10+, a single person can solo it) 
- The boss gets killed very very fast generally, host don't need to do anything but send out invites, supporters will kill it for you. Host gets 135 + 15 per level Analysis points (150 for level 1, 165 or level 2, etc). Supporters gets 27 + 3 per level Analysis Points (30 for level 1, 33 for level 2, etc). You get 2 host per day and 3 support per day. Host counter is above your Analysis point count, if it's greyed out, you will stop accumulating coordinate points. Support counter is on the top right of the Ashes Showdown interfact.
- The strat is: if you host then go in, change your fleet to your best boss slayer fleet (torp front will nuke the boss in 5s flat), save your fleet, get out and invite people, ignore it for a min and do your support attempts while waiting. Now you get 2 host per day and 3 support per day. To use your support entries: sit in chat, wait till someone post and spam to get in OR spam refresh button on boss list and click attack till you get a fight and get your 30 something points. Have fun~~~

#### Patch Note that explains this in a long-winded way:
You can obtain Analysis Points by defeating the META boss in Ashes Showdown.
Achieve Analysis Point milestones to obtain META ships and other rewards.

Ashes Showdown involves the following 2 elements,
1) Ashes Coordinate Analysis (unlocking the boss fight)
2) Fighting the META boss

※ Ashes Showdown is unlocked after clearing chapter 1 of the Operation Siren story campaign.

★ Ashes Coordinate Analysis
You can obtain Ashes Coordinates from a number of ways including defeating enemies.
The number of Ashes Coordinates is displayed on the upper right corner of the sea region map.

Once you have obtained the max number of Ashes Coordinates, you can unlock the META boss fight by performing Coordinate Analysis using all of your Coordinates.
You can only perform Coordinate Analysis twice per day.
After daily reset, you will be able to perform Coordinate Analysis again, but the number of your Ashes Coordinates will be reset back to the starting number.

★ Fighting the META boss
You can access the fight from the button on the lower right corner of the sea region map.
The META boss fight involves,
1) The fight that you yourself unlock
2) Any requests for backup that you accept from other commanders.

Fleets sortied for Operation Siren can be used for the boss fight. Meowfficers and submarines cannot be used.
Once you complete a META boss fight that you unlocked yourself, the next META boss will be harder (a level increase).
Requesting for backup allows other commanders to access your META boss fight.

Defeating the boss rewards Analysis Points. If it was a coop fight, all commanders who participated will receive Analysis Points.

※ A META boss fight will be open for 24 hours.
※ You may spend Fuel and attempt the META boss fight which you unlocked yourself as many times as you would like until the boss is defeated.
※ There is a limit on how many backup requests you can accept per day.
※ A maximum of 30 commanders can participate in 1 Ashes Showdown. The boss fight will become unable to join once full.
※ Ashes Showdown does not give any ship EXP nor does it affect ship morale and affection.
